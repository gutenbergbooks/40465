<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><b>THE</b> first edition of this book was
printed before I had thought to
write a preface.</p>

<p>Now, my readers may not care
for a preface, but as a writer I do not
feel that a book is completed until the
author has said a word or two.</p>

<p>You don't hand a man a glass of wine
or even an innocuous apple in silence:
you say, "Here's looking at you," or,
"Have an apple?" and the recipient
says, "Thanks, I don't care if I do," or,
"Thanks, I don't eat apples." In either
case you have done what you expected
of yourself, and that, let me tell you, is
no small satisfaction.</p>

<p>So now that my publisher has thought
it worth while to get out an illustrated
edition of this unpretentious record of
pleasant (though rainy) days in Ireland,
it is my pleasure to say to all who may
be about to pick it up, "Don't be afraid
of it&mdash;it won't hurt you. It was written
by a Protestant, but while he was in
Ireland his only thought was that God
was good to give him such a pleasant
time and to make people so well disposed
toward him. It was written by a man
without a drop of Irish blood in his
veins (as far as he knows), but he felt
that he was among his brothers in race,
because their ideas so chimed in with
his, and every one made him so comfortable."</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to thank
those of Irish birth or extraction who in
their papers and magazines said such
nice things about the book.</p>

<p>The pictures, all snap shots, were
taken by me, and even the Irish atmosphere
was friendly to my purpose, and
gave me considerable success. A pleasanter
five weeks of travel I never had,
and if you who read this have never
visited Ireland, don't get too old before
doing so. And if you do visit it give
yourself up to it, and you'll have a good
time.</p>

<p>Here's the book&mdash;like it if you can,
drop it if you don't. Never waste time
over a book that is not meant for you.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A Taste of Irish Hospitality</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>"IRISH</b> hospitality." I have often
heard the term used, but I did not
suppose that I should get such convincing
evidence of it within twelve hours of
my arrival at this northern port.</p>

<p>This is to be a straightforward relation
of what happened to some half
dozen Americans, strangers to each other,
a week ago, and strangers to all Ireland
upon arrival.</p>

<p>In details it is somewhat unusual,
but in spirit I am sure it is characteristic of
what might have befallen good Americans
in any one of the four provinces.</p>

<p>To be dumped into the tender that
came down the Foyle to meet the Caledonia
at Moville at the chilly hour of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
two in the morning seemed at the time
a hardship. We had wanted to see the
green hills of old Ireland and here were
blackness and bleakness and crowded
humanity.</p>

<p>But the loading process was long
drawn out, and when at last we began
our ascent of the Foyle there were indubitable
symptoms of morning in the
eastern skies, and we saw that our
entrance into the tender was like the
entrance of early ones into a theater
before the lights are turned up. After
a while the curtain is lifted and the
scenic glories are revealed to eyes that
have developed a proper amount of
eagerness and receptivity.</p>

<p>With the first steps of day a young
Irishman returning to his native land
mounted a seat and recited an apostrophe,
"The top of the mornin' to ye,"
and then a mist lifting suddenly, Ireland,
dewily green and soft and fair, lay revealed
before our appreciative eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i01" src="images/i019.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Real Irish Bull</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun, when he really began his
morning brushwork, painted the trees
and grasses in more vivid greens, but
there was a suggestiveness of early spring
in the first soft tones that was fully
valued by eyes that had been used to
leaden skies for more than half the days
of the voyage.</p>

<p>But I am no poet to paint landscapes
on paper, so we will consider ourselves
landed at Londonderry and furnished
with a few hours of necessary sleep, and
anxious to begin our adventures.</p>

<p>Our party consisted of a half dozen
whose itineraries were to run in parallels
for a time. There were four ladies
and two of us were men. One of the
men had to come to Ireland on business,
and he found he had awaiting him an
invitation to lunch that day with a
country gentleman with whom he had
corresponded on business matters.</p>

<p>As the one least strange to the country
this American had tendered his good
offices, American fashion, to the ladies
who would be traveling without male
companions after we left them, and so he
dispatched a messenger with a note to
the effect that he must regretfully decline,
and stating his reasons for so doing.</p>

<p>While we were lunching at the hotel
a return note came to him, this time
from the good man's wife, cordially
asking that we all come and have afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>Here was a chance to see an Irish
household that was hailed with delight
by all, a delight that was not unappreciative
of the warmth of the invitation.</p>

<p>We would go to the pleasant country
house, but&mdash;our trunks had not
come. Would our traveler's togs worthily
represent our country?</p>

<p>But our friend said, "Don't let clothes
stand between us and this thing. I'm
sure this lady will be glad to welcome us
as Americans, and for my part I never
reflect credit on my tailor, and people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
never clamor for his address when they
see me. As for you ladies, I'd think
any tea of mine honored by such fetching
gowns, if that's the proper term. I'm
going to write her that we're coming
just as we are."</p>

<p>So he sent another messenger out
into the country&mdash;telephones seem as
scarce as snakes here&mdash;saying, well,
he used a good assortment of words and
arranged them worthily.</p>

<p>The two young girls of the party
clamored for jaunting cars, and so two
were ordered for four o'clock. One of
them had red cushions and was as
glittering in its glass and gold as a
circus wagon.</p>

<p>My friend, on ordering this one, said
to the "jarvey" (by the way, they call
them drivers here in this part of Ireland,
but jarvey has always seemed
so delightfully Irish that I prefer to stick
to it), "Get another car as nice as this."</p>

<p>"Sure, there's none as nice as this,"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
said he, pride forcing the confession,
"but I'll get a good one."</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day except for the
extreme heat&mdash;and yet they say it always
rains in Ireland. I felt that it
must be exceptional, and said to the
waiter at lunch, "I suppose it's unusual
to have such weather as this?"
"Sure, every day is like this," said he
with patriotic mendacity.</p>

<p>When the jaunty jaunting cars drew
up a little before four o'clock there were
portentous black clouds in the sky, but
the jarvies assured us that they were
there more for looks than anything else&mdash;that
there might be a matter of a spit or
two, but that we'd have a fine afternoon.</p>

<p>So we mounted the sides of the cars,
and holding on to the polished rails,
as we had been told was the proper
fashion, we set out bravely on our way,
little wotting what a wetting all Ireland
was soon to have.</p>

<p>In a half hour or so we would be
walking over Irish lawns and admiring
Irish laces as they decked the forms
of gaily clad femininity gathered for sociability
and tea alongside the rhododendrons
and fuchsia bushes.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Government Cottage, rent a shilling a week</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>A few drops of rain fell, but the wind
was south and we seemed to be going
east.</p>

<p>"Isn't this gay?" called the young
girls, as we jiggled along in holiday
mood. Suddenly a silver bolt of jagged
lightning cleft the sky to the south,
and almost instantaneously a peal of
thunder that sounded as if it had been
born and bred on Connecticut hills, so
loud was it, told us that the people living
to the south of us were going to get wet.</p>

<p>And then we came to a bend in the
road and turned south.</p>

<p>"Ah, 'twill be nothin'," said our driver,
in answer to a question.</p>

<p>To give up what one has undertaken
is a poor way of playing a game and we
were all for going on. "It's not so far,"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
said the jarvey, but this was a sort of
truth that depended on what he was comparing
the distance with. It was not so
far as Dublin, for instance, but 'twas far
enough as the event proved.</p>

<p>We put on our cravenettes, hoisted
what umbrellas we had, and gave the
blankets an extra tucking in and after
that&mdash;the deluge!</p>

<p>Bang, kerrassh! A bolt from heaven
followed by a bolt from each horse. A
sort of echo as it were. The drivers
reined them in and ours started to seek
shelter under a tree.</p>

<p>As I sometimes read the newspapers
when at home I told our driver to keep
in the open.</p>

<p>The lightning now became more and
more frequent and was so close that we
let go our hold on the brass rails, preferring
to pitch out rather than act as
conductor on a jaunting car&mdash;such
things as conductors being unknown
anyway.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>It was terrifying, and to add to my
discomfort I found I was sitting in a
pool of water, the rain having an Irish
insinuatingness about it that was irresistible.
And now, just to show us what
could be gotten up on short notice for
American visitors, it began to hail and the
wind blew it in long, white, slanting,
winter-like lines across the air and into our
faces, and the roads having become little
brooks, the horses had to be urged to the
driver's utmost of threats and cajolery.</p>

<p>I thought of that waiter who had told
me it was always sunny in Ireland and
I wished him out in the pelting storm.</p>

<p>"I've not seen the like in twinty yairs,
sirr," said the driver.</p>

<p>To go back was to get the storm in
fuller fury, for the wind had shifted.
To go ahead was to arrive like drowned
rats, but we were anxious for shelter,
and still the driver said, "It's not far,"
and so we went on. I have been in
many places in all sorts of weathers, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
it is years since I've been out in such a
storm. The hailstones were not as large
as hen's eggs, but they were as large as
French peas.</p>

<p>There was not a dry stitch on us and
the red of the gay cushion went through
to my skin. My cravenette treacherously
refused to let the water depart from
me, but shed it on the wrong side&mdash;which
may be an Irish bull, for all I
know.</p>

<p>"Here we are now, sirr," said our
driver, as he turned in at a beautiful driveway.
A winding drive of a minute or
two and we arrived like wet hens&mdash;all
of us&mdash;at the house of these people who
had never heard of us until that day.</p>

<p>But the warmth of the welcome from
our host and hostess who came out to
the door to greet us made us not only
glad we had come, but even glad we
were wet.</p>

<p>Had there been the least stiffness we
should have wished the storm far enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
(and indeed all Ireland did wish it, for it
turned out to be the most tremendous
thunder and hailstorm in a score or more
of years), but our new found friends
frankly laughed with us at our funny
appearance, and we were hurried off to
various rooms to change our clothes.</p>

<p>Our protestations of regret at putting
them to trouble were met with protestations
of delight at being able to serve
us, and as my host brought me some union
garments that had been made for a man
of three times my size and I wrapped them
round and round me until they were
giddy, I was glad I had not turned back
to spend a damp afternoon in a lonely
hotel.</p>

<p>The rest of the party fared well in
getting clothes that became them, but
when I was fully dressed I looked like
Francis Wilson in Erminie. As I turned
up my sleeves and triple turned up my
trousers I knew I would be good for a
laugh in any theater in Christendom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>There was but one thing to do&mdash;go
down and look unconscious of my misfit
appearance. It would never do to
stay in my room through a mistaken
sense of personal dignity.</p>

<p>So I went down, and meeting host and
hostess and my compatriots, a laugh
went up that would have broken the
ice in a Pittsburgh millionaire's drawing
room.</p>

<p>And then we were taken to the tearoom
and in a few minutes I forgot that
I was no longer the glass of fashion and
the mold of form, for I was made to feel
that I was just a friend who had dropped
in (or, perhaps, dripped in would be
better), and when a couple of hours
later we drove home through the soft
Irish verdure, doubly green after its
rough but invigorating bath, we all felt
that Irish hospitality was no mere traveler's
tale, but a thing that had intensity
and not a little emotion in it.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>Around about Lough Swilly</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>TO</b> a tired New Yorker who has sixteen
days at his disposal I would recommend
a day on Lough Swilly at Rathmullan.
It is separated from the island
of Manhattan by little else than the Atlantic,
and every one knows that a sea voyage
is good for a wearied man.</p>

<p>Take a boat for Londonderry from
the foot of Twenty-fourth Street, and then
for the mere cost of a shilling (if you
travel third class, and that is the way to
fall in with characters) you will be railroaded
and ferried to Rathmullan, where
you'll find as clean an inn and as faithful
service as heart could wish. And such
scenery!</p>

<p>And every one will be glad to see you,
because you are from America. ("Welcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
from the other side," and a hearty
hand grip from leathery hands.)</p>

<p>Of course a day is a short time in
which to get the full benefit of the peaceful
atmosphere of the place and perhaps
you will stay on as we are doing for
several days.</p>

<p>Then you can return for a shilling to
'Derry, take Saturday's steamer to the
foot of Twenty-fourth Street, New York,
and you'll soon be walking the streets of
the metropolis filled with pleasant memories
of one of nature's beauty spots.</p>

<p>Lough Swilly is an arm of the Atlantic
and its waters are salt. At Rathmullan
the lough is surrounded by lofty green
hills, mostly treeless, gently sloping to
the water, and for the better part of the
time softened in tone by an Indian summer
haze indescribably beautiful.</p>

<p>We came down according to the program
I have outlined, and traveled third
class for the reason I have stated, but as
the only other occupant of the coach was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a lone "widow woman" we were unable to
get any characteristic conversation. In
fact, up here in Donegal, as far as I have
observed, the natives talk more like the
Scotch than they do like the Irish made
known to us by certain actors. When
I get south I expect to hear rich brogues,
but here the burr is Scotch.</p>

<p>We were ferried from Fahan in a side-wheel
steamer, and soon the painfully
neat-looking white houses of Rathmullan
lay before us and we disembarked, and
carrying our own grips unmolested (a sure
sign of an unusual place) we made our
way up the stone pier between restless
steers who were waiting for us to get out
of the way so that they could go to the
slaughter house. There had been a cattle
fair that day in Rathmullan.</p>

<p>We knew little of the town save what
Stephen Gwynn says of it in his delightful
"Highways and Byways in Donegal
and Antrim."</p>

<p>There is a most picturesque and ivy-grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
ruin of an abbey dating back to
the fifteenth century. It is much more
beautiful than Kenilworth.</p>

<p>We bent our steps to the plain-looking
little inn, and entering the taproom
we asked for lodgings for the night.
The inn is kept by a widow who still
bears trace of a beauty that must have
been transcendent in her girlhood. As
it is, she could serve as a model to some
artist for an allegorical painting representing
"Sorrowful Ireland"; the arched
eyebrows, the melting eyes, the long,
classic nose, and the grieving mouth&mdash;very
Irish and very lovely.</p>

<p>We have seen many pretty women
here in Ireland, but in her day this inn
keeper must have been the peer of any.</p>

<p>Her husband kept the inn formerly,
but as an Irishman told me, "He died
suddenly. Throuble with the head," said
he, tapping his own. "'Twas heart disease,
I think." This is the first Irish
bull I've heard.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">To the Men of '98</span> OLIVER SHEPHARD, SCULPTOR</p>

<p>My companion thought he would like
a room fronting Lough Swilly and so
did I.</p>

<p>The maid who had taken charge of
us said that that wouldn't be possible,
as the only available rooms having such
an outlook had been engaged by wire.</p>

<p>"But," said my insistent friend, who
is the type of American who gets what
he wants by smiles if possible, but who
certainly gets it, "they won't be here
to-day, will they?"</p>

<p>"No, not to-day; to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, let us have the rooms for to-night."</p>

<p>"But, will ye give them up when they
come?" said she, still hesitating.</p>

<p>"Surely. Depend upon it. Count on
us to vamoose just as soon as you give
the word."</p>

<p>"But these people come every year,"
said she tenaciously.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder at it," said O'Donnell.
(My friend is of Irish descent.) "I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a><br /><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
would, too, if I didn't live so far away.
Don't you worry, honey. We'll just go
out like little lambs as soon as you give
the word."</p>

<p>There was something delightfully quaint
in the notion that because people were
coming to the rooms to-morrow night
we ought not to have them to-night&mdash;the
girl was perfectly sincere. She evidently
knew the lure of sunrise on the
mountains and the lake and feared her
ability to oust us once we were ensconced.</p>

<p>"We're passing on to-morrow and
will be <i>just</i> as <i>careful</i> of the rooms,"
said O'Donnell in the tone of one who
talks to a child, and the pretty maid
succumbed, and our valises were deposited
in the coveted rooms.</p>

<p>But just as she left us she said once
more, "You'll go when they come, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"We sure will," said O'Donnell, with
a solemnity that carried conviction with
it. "Now about dinner," said he; "we'd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
like dinner at six thirty. It's now four."</p>

<p>"We haven't begun to serve dinners
at night yet," said the maid. The summer
season had evidently not begun.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too bad," said O'Donnell,
"but you'll make an exception in our
case now, won't you?"</p>

<p>She thought a minute, and O'Donnell
smiled on her.</p>

<p>I can imagine ice banks melting under
that smile.</p>

<p>"I suppose we could give you hot
roast chicken," said she.</p>

<p>"Why, of course you could. Roast
chicken is just what you <i>could</i> give us,
and potatoes with their jackets on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And soup," said the girl, evidently
excited over the prospect.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll leave the rest to you."</p>

<p>So we went out and walked through
the lovely countryside, noting that in
Ireland fuchsias grow to the proportions
of our lilac bushes and are loaded
with the pretty red flowers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>We were unable to name most of the
trees we saw (but that sometimes happens
in America), yet we were both sure
we had not seen their like at home. And
the freshness of them all, the brilliant
quality of their green, fulfilled all expectations.</p>

<p>We took a long walk and arrived at the
inn with appetites sharpened.</p>

<p>Friends in America had told me that
I'd not fare very well in Ireland except
in the large towns. I would like to ask
at what small hotel&mdash;New York or
Chicago or Philadelphia&mdash;I would get
as well cooked or as well served a dinner
as was brought to me in Londonderry
for three shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p>If one is looking for Waldorf magnificence
and French disguises he'll not
find them here unless it is at Dublin, but
if one is blessed with a good appetite
and is willing to put up with plain cooking
I fancy he will do better here than at
like hotels at home.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Prosperity in Limerick</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The Irish are such good cooks that
we in the east (of America) have been
employing them for two generations.
Let us not forget that.</p>

<p>We entered the dining-room and had
an appetizing soup and then the Irish
potatoes (oh, such Irish potatoes!) and
anything tenderer or better cooked than
the chicken it would have been hard to
find. We looked at each other and decided
that we would not go on to Port
Salon next day, but would spend another
night in Rathmullan, and we said so to
the maid.</p>

<p>"But you'll take other rooms?" said
she, alarmed at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, honey, we'll go anywhere
you put us."</p>

<p>Now you know we had an itinerary,
and to stay longer at Rathmullan was
to cut it short somewhere else, but the
stillness and calm, the purple shadows
on the mountains and the lake (Lough
Swilly means Lake of Shadows), had us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
gripped and we were content to stay and
make the most of it.</p>

<p>A simple, golden rule sort of people
the inhabitants are. We came on a
man clipping hawthorn bushes and asked
him how far it was to a certain point and
whether we could "car" it there.</p>

<p>He told us we could and then he said,
"Were ye thinkin' of hirin' a car, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"I have one," said he.</p>

<p>"Well," said O'Donnell, "we've talked
to the landlady about hiring hers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said the man. "Sure I
don't want ye to take mine if she expects
to rint hers."</p>

<p>Such altruism!</p>

<p>We had comfortable beds in the rooms
that had been engaged by wire "for
to-morrow," and indeed they were so
comfortable that we never saw the sunrise
at all. But the view from our windows
was worth the price of the rooms
and that was&mdash;listen!&mdash;two shillings
and sixpence apiece!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Wheat porridge and fresh eggs (oh,
so fresh!) and yellow cream and graham
bread and jam for breakfast. What
more do you want?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I know your kind, my dear
sir.</p>

<p>"What! no steak? No chops, and
fried ham and buckwheat cakes and
oranges and grapefruit and hot rolls?
What sort of a hotel is this for an American?
You tell the landlady that they
don't know how to run hotels in this
country. You tell her to come to God's
country, that's what. Then she'll learn
how."</p>

<p>Yes, then she'll learn how to set out
ten or twelve dinkey little saucers of peas
and corn and beans and turnips and rice,
all tasting alike.</p>

<p>But Mr. O'Donnell and I will continue
to like the simplicity of this inn.</p>

<p>We astonished the easy-going natives
by climbing the mountain on Inch Island
in the morning for the magnificent view<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and going fishing for young cod in the
afternoon. The young fellow who took
us out had the somewhat Chinese name
of Toye, but he was Irish.</p>

<p>When it came time to settle for the
use of the boat and his services for a
matter of two hours he wanted to leave
it with us.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said O'Donnell. "Your
Uncle Dudley doesn't do business that
way," with one of his beaming smiles.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know what to charge,
sir, pay me what's right."</p>

<p>"That's just it. I don't know what's
right."</p>

<p>"Well, ye were not out so long. Is
two shillin's apiece right?"</p>

<p>"Very good, indeed, and here's sixpence
extra for you," said O'Donnell,
paying him.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir," said the boy,
evidently thinking the tip far too much.</p>

<p>But as we had caught forty-eight fish in
the hour we were at the fishing grounds
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>we felt that it was worth it. Sixpence&mdash;and
to be sincerely thanked for it!
There are those who are not money grubbers.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mackerel Seller, Bundoran, Donegal</span></p>

<p>They use a tackle here that they call
"chop sticks"&mdash;two pieces of bamboo
fastened at right angles, from which depend
the gut and hooks, while back of
them is the heavy sinker. The sinker
rests on the bottom and the ugly red
"lugs" (bait) play around in the water
until they are gulped by the voracious
coddlings, or cod. We had small hooks
and caught only the youngsters.</p>

<p>Time after time we threw in our lines,
got "two strikes" at once and pulled
in two cod as fast as we could pull in the
line.</p>

<p>No sport in the way of fight on the
part of the party of the second part, but
not a little excitement in thus hauling in
toothsome food.</p>

<p>We had them for supper and I tell
you, O tired business man, if you want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to know how good fish can taste, come
over here and go a-fishin'. Like us you
will stay on and on.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, about those other people.
No, we didn't get out of our rooms, because
the landlady had relatives in America
and so she made other arrangements
for her expected guests and we stayed on
and overlooked Lough Swilly.</p>

<p>Americans are popular over here.
But I hope they won't spoil these simple
folk with either excessive tipping or excessive
grumbling.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A Joyful Day in Donegal</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>HOLLAND</b> is noted the world over
for its neatness. The Dutch
housewives spend a good part of each
morning in scrubbing the sidewalks in
front of their houses. Philadelphia is also
a clean town and there you will see house-maids
out scrubbing the front stoops and
the brick pavements. Now a good part
of the inhabitants of Donegal emigrate
to Philadelphia. (We in America all know
the song, "For I'm Off to Philadelphia
in the Morning.") Well, the third neatest
place that occurs to me is Rathmullan,
in Lough Swilly, in County Donegal.</p>

<p>Whether Philadelphia is neat because
of the Irish or the Irish of Donegal go to
Philadelphia because it is neat, I leave to
others to determine.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>All my life I've read and have been
told that the north of Ireland was very
different from the south; that the people
were better off and more thrifty, but
I did not expect to see such scrupulous
neatness. The houses are mostly white
and severely plain in line, built of stone
faced with plaster, sometimes smooth and
sometimes rough finished, but always in
apple-pie order (unless they were on
parade the three days I was there). Even
the alleys are sweet and clean, and where
the people keep their pigs is a mystery to
me. I snapped one, but he was being
driven hither and thither after the manner
of Irish pigs, and may not have lived
in Rathmullan at all.</p>

<p>Here in the town of Donegal while the
houses are not of Philadelphia neatness,
they show evidence of housewifely care,
and if there is abject poverty it is carefully
concealed. (I have been a week in
Ireland and I have not seen a beggar or a
drunken man, although I have kept my
eyes moving rapidly.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i07" src="images/i057.jpg" width="400" height="602" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">In Donegal</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>How often must an emigrant who has
elected to live in noisome tenements in
American cities long for the white cottages
and the green lanes and noble
mountains and verdant valleys of Donegal!</p>

<p>Every hotel at which I have stopped
so far has had hot and cold water baths
and I have only been to small towns.</p>

<p>I heard a bathing story from a vivacious
Irish lady at an evening gathering
that may never have seen American
printer's ink.</p>

<p>She said that in former times a lady
stopping at a primitive hotel in the west
of Ireland asked for a bath. She was
told by the maid that a colonel was performing
his ablutions in the room in
which the bathing pan was set.</p>

<p>"But he'll not be long, I'm thinkin',
miss," said the maid.</p>

<p>This lady waited awhile in her room,
and at last growing impatient, she stepped
out into the hall and found the maid with
her eye to the keyhole of the bathroom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>On hearing the lady's footstep she
turned around quite unabashed and said,
"He'll be ready in a minute, miss. He's
just after gettin' out of the tub."</p>

<p>This story was told me in a drawing-room
with many young people present,
so it must be true, but candor compels
me to say that I have observed nothing
of the kind on this trip. There are no
terrors like those of a bath in an English
tub of which I had occasion to speak
last year.</p>

<p>Speaking of anecdotes, I heard one
that concerned the father of the man
who showed us through the lovely ruins
of McSwiney's castle at Rathmullan.
Son, father, and grandfather have all in
their turn acted as caretakers of the ruins,
and proud enough is the son of his position.</p>

<p>But it is of the father that the story
goes.</p>

<p>The wife of an English admiral, whose
family were in the habit of being buried
in the graveyard adjoining the abbey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
whenever they died, departed this life, and
to "Jimmy" fell the task of digging her
grave.</p>

<p>Meeting the admiral some two weeks
later he said, "It'll be ten shillings for
yon grave."</p>

<p>"Is it ten shillings, man?" said the
admiral. "Why that's extortionate. I'll
pay five shillings and that's a shilling
more than usual, but I'll not pay ten
shillings."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Jimmy, composedly,
"if ye'll not pay ten shillings then I'll
dig her up again." And the admiral,
knowing Jimmy to be a man of his word,
paid him what does not look to be an
exorbitant price.</p>

<p>Among the most impressive ruins in
the world are those of the Grianan (or
summer palace) of Aileach on Elagh
mountain. Here is a circular fort of
rocks some three hundred feet in circumference
that antedates Christ's nativity
by from two thousand to three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
years. It is supposed to have been a
temple of the sun worshippers and occupies
a magnificent and awesome position
from which to see either the arrival
or the departure of the sun god, for the
half of County Donegal lies north, south,
east, and west at your feet. Such an
extended view is seldom vouchsafed to
the dwellers within towns and I don't
wonder that the sun worshippers built
there a temple to their deity.</p>

<p>There it still stands, its walls eighteen
feet high and twelve feet thick. It has
been somewhat restored by Dr. Bernard,
of Derry, but does not seem to
vie with the Giant's Causeway as an attraction
to visitors. There were only
three persons there when we went up,
but there is a holy well just outside of it
and from the number of bandages fluttering
in the wind there I imagine that a good
many maimed people manage to scale the
steep ascent.</p>

<p>I said that Elagh mountain afforded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
a fine view for the dwellers within towns.
It is only six miles by car and a mile by
foot (I suppose seven miles in any manner
would cover it) from Derry.</p>

<p>By the way, for ease and comfort to a
naturally lazy man, commend me to a
jaunting car. The cushioned top with
which they cover the "well" that lies
between the sidewise seats is an admirable
place on which to "slop over" and loll on
from the seat, and so far from being an insecure
perch, it is just as safe as a dog
cart or a buggy. And the motion is
pleasantly stimulating to the system.
The well-built, vigorous, well-fed cob
trots with the regularity of a metronome
or a London cab horse, reeling off mile
after mile. We did our twelve miles to
and from Elagh mountain in less than
two hours and at a cost of three shillings
apiece, exclusive of the sixpenny tip.
They don't do those things as cheap in
New York or Chicago.</p>

<p>At Donegal my friend had to see a solicitor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
on business and after it was over he
came to me and said that the solicitor
would like to take us sailing down
Donegal Bay. I was delighted to go,
but I wondered whether we would walk
down to the bay or ride there. I knew
that it was several miles out, for I had
seen it across the wet sands that stretch
from the town's center seaward.</p>

<p>My uncertainty was soon dispelled,
for two minutes' walk brought us to
where the bare sands had been a few
hours before, and lo, Donegal Bay had
come to us and the solicitor's boat was
riding on the water waiting to be off.
A tide is a handy thing to have about.</p>

<p>As one leaves the inlet and looks back
he gets a picture that might have been
composed by an exceedingly successful
landscape gardener. The trim little town
showing a bit of the ruins of Donegal
castle and one graceful church spire,
wooded hills running up from the town
on either side; back of all this hills of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
greater magnitude, destitute of trees, and
then, towering up in the distance, the
great, gaunt Barnesmore that forms part
of a heaven-kissing train.</p>

<p>We sailed well out into the bay with
favoring winds, and had most noble views
of purple mountains on every side, but
when we turned to go back the wind made
off to sea, laughing at us, and we came
back laggingly, but in plenty of time for a
cozy supper in the solicitor's home and
an all evening chat with him.</p>

<p>We had never met until that day, but
his welcome was as hearty as if he had
been anxiously awaiting our coming.</p>

<p>As I got off the train at Donegal a
heavy hand clapped me on the shoulder,
and, turning, I saw Seumas McManus,
whose Irish stories are so well known in
America.</p>

<p>He lives at Mount Charles, a village
lying three Irish miles from Donegal, and
nothing would do but my friend and I
must have dinner with him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>We accepted with pleasure, and next
day walked up there, meeting more pretty
girls returning from mass than it seemed
right for two to meet when there were
so many people in the world who seldom
see a pretty face. But we tried to bear
our good fortune meekly and strode on,
quite conscious in the warm sun that an
Irish mile has an English mile beaten by
many yards. That ought to be cause
for satisfaction to any Irishman.</p>

<p>McManus has a bungalow on top
of Mount Charles, and at his feet lie seven
counties. They have a way of throwing
counties at your feet in this part of Ireland
that makes the view superb. The
furthermost land that is his to look at
on a clear day lies a hundred miles to the
south.</p>

<p>Such a view ought to stimulate a man
to noble thoughts, and I was not surprised
to learn that McManus is a member
of the Sinn Fein (Shinn Fane) Society
(it means, "Ourselves Alone"),
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>what one might call bloodless revolutionists,
although it comprises much of the
best blood and the youngest blood in
Ireland.</p>

<p class="h3"><i>The Dull Gray Skies of Ireland</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>I AM</b> coming more and more to believe
that we have better weather in
America than we give the poor country
credit for. What passes for good
weather here would make a poor substitute
for the American article. I will
not deny that it is soft and insinuating,
but it is also not to be depended upon.
I went out to climb a wild-looking mountain
near Bundoran, on the northwest
coast. To my inexperienced eye the day
looked promising&mdash;that is promising
rain&mdash;but the driver, of whom I had
ordered a car to take me to the base of
the mountain, said there'd be no rain.
All those ugly clouds hovering over the
summit of it were merely reminders that
there was such a thing as rain, and so we
started.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i09" src="images/i071.jpg" width="400" height="599" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Sky Line at Bundoran</span></p>

<p>And here let me make a few remarks
about Irish weather in general. You
are out walking in a fine "mizzle," that
penetrates ordinary cloth with the utmost
ease, and you meet a countryman to
whom you observe "Not very pleasant."
"Oh, it's a bit soft, but it's pleasant
enough." What a blessing it is to be
easily satisfied.</p>

<p>You strike a day without sun and positively
chilly, and the natives assure you
it is fine, that they had awful weather
last week, but that, according to the barometer,
the weather is going to be steady
for awhile. They have borrowed the
barometer habit from the English, and it
really is a comfort when you're going
for a long walk or drive to see that it
points to fair. "Fair to middling" would
be better.</p>

<p>Well, my driver and I set out for the
mountain, and on the way I asked him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a><br /><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the question I ask all of the peasants
with whom I hold conversation, "Would
you like to go to America?"</p>

<p>"Sure I would. I'll not be stayin'
here long. I've an aunt an' a brother
an' a cousin an' a sister an' an uncle
beyant. There's no chance here."</p>

<p>I wonder whether the reason why
there is no chance is because the Irishman
is lacking in application. I fell in
with a delightful man at a little town in
County Fermanagh. I wanted a little
thing done to my watch and I asked him
how long it would take to do it.</p>

<p>He assured me that he was driven
to death with work and was up till late
every night trying to get ahead, but that
he would try to find time to mend my
watch some time before seven o'clock,
when he nominally closed. Then he
followed me to the door of his shop and
began to ask me questions about America,
which I was glad to answer, as I
had a half hour to kill before starting for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
some sight or other, and I killed that half
hour most agreeably with the little man's
help. He pointed out different passers
by and told me their life histories. And
every once in a while he would say, "I've
not had a day off for nearly a year, not
even bank holiday. Never a minute
for anything but work. I've an order
now that's going to keep me busy, except
for the time I'll give to your watch, all
the rest of the day. And dinner eaten
in my workshop to save time."</p>

<p>I told him I wished he wasn't so driven,
but I knew how it was with a man who
did good work, and then I bade him good
day and didn't go near there until seven
in the evening. I found him outside the
shop discussing the strike of the constabulary
at Belfast with a neighbor.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, sir, but I've been so
busy to-day that I've been unable to
finish that job. It'll not take over
twenty minutes when I get to it. Can
you come in the morning?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>I told him I could, say about eight
o'clock.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no. We don't open the
shops until nine."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, nine will do."</p>

<p>And having some more time that I
wished to kill I entered into a discussion
with him and his neighbor as to
the extent to which the constabulary
disaffection would spread, and it was
eight o'clock when I went back to my
hotel.</p>

<p>Next morning I was at the shop at
nine and he was just taking down the
shutters. Said he'd worked until ten
the night before, but seemed further
behind than before. If I'd come up
into his workroom he'd fix my watch
while I waited.</p>

<p>Up there he had some photographs
to show me that he had taken a year
ago and had only just found time to
develop, and we talked photography for
a matter of twenty minutes, and then he
fixed my watch in a jiffy when he got to
work.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Rocks at Bundoran on the West Coast</span></p>

<p>He's typical not only of Irishmen, but
of Yankees, too&mdash;men who can work
fast if you seal their mouths.</p>

<p>I was sorry I had to journey on, because
our talks had been pleasant and
it had never once entered his head that
he was wasting that time of which he had
so little, although he dealt in watches.</p>

<p>But to return to my driver.</p>

<p>When we reached the base of the
mountain he put the horse up in a stone
stable that belonged to a poor woman.
Think of a poor woman housing her cow
in a stone stable, built to stand the wear
and tear of generations!</p>

<p>We had no sooner begun our climb
of the hill or mountain than the rain
came down in earnest, and my shoes
were soon wet through, but I persevered,
somewhat to the disappointment of the
boy, who was better used to being wet on
his car than on foot. But when we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a><br /><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
reached the top the view of all Donegal
bay and the mountains beyond, and
many other bits of geography not half as
beautiful on the map as they are in nature,
repaid me for my climb and wetting.</p>

<p>And when I said, "It's too bad it
rained just as we got here," my driver
said, "It's always rainin' on the mountains,"
although when he was getting
me for a passenger he had assured me
it wouldn't rain on the mountain.</p>

<p>We made our way down through the
wet, but still beautifully purple heather,
and just as we reached the level the rain
stopped. It was as if our feet upon the
mountain had precipitated the rain.</p>

<p>But at the close of the drive I found
a comfortable inn and a most agreeable
dinner of fresh caught fish, and that
mutton that we never seem to get in
America, and I still felt that the climb
was worth the wetting.</p>

<p>But the weather never ceases to astonish
me. Dull gray skies at home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
would depress me, but here I am thankful
for dull gray skies if they only stop leaking
long enough to enable me to do my
accomplished task of walking or driving.</p>

<p>But real rain has no terrors for countryman
or city man in Ireland. I attended
a concert at the exhibition in Dublin
(and it would not have been a tax on the
imagination to pretend one was at Lunar
Park in Coney Island or at the French
Exposition or the Pan-American). There
was the usual bandstand, and the Dublin
populace to the extent of several thousands
were seated on little chairs listening to the
combined bands of H. M. Second Life
Guards, the Eighty-seventh Royal Irish
Fusiliers (Faugh-a-Ballaghs) and the
Forty-second Royal Highlanders (the
Black Watch).</p>

<p>Outside the circle of those in seats
passed and repassed a slowly promenading
crowd made up of pretty Dublin
girls and their escorts, with mustaches
as spindle-waxed as ever any Frenchman's,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a sprinkling of English, and the
ever-present Americans, with their alert
eyes, the Americans straw-hatted, the
English derbied, and the Irish, almost
to a man, wearing huge, soft green or
gray-visored cloth caps.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rain began to fall.</p>

<p>I know at least two Americans who
put for shelter, but the Irish people
present merely put up umbrellas and
went on promenading and sitting and
listening to the music. Gay strains from
"The Mikado" (there were no Japanese
present), somber umbrellas, colorful millinery
and drizzling rain. An American
crowd would have made for the main
exhibition building, but I doubt if the
Dubliners noticed that it was raining.
Their umbrellas went up under subconscious
direction.</p>

<p>After the concert the crowds went
home in the double-decker electric trams,
and every seat on the roof of every car
was filled by the holiday crowd, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the rain was still coming down in a relentless
fashion.</p>

<p>In the north they would have called
it a bit soft. I know we felt like mush
when we arrived at our hotel.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>The Joys of Third-Class Travel</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>IN</b> Ireland, if you wish to travel third
class, it is well to get into a carriage
marked "non smoking." If there is no
sign on it it is a smoking compartment,
quite probably, the custom here being
often the direct opposite of that in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>If you are traveling with women in
the party the second class is advisable,
but the third has this advantage&mdash;it
saves you money that you can spend on
worthless trinkets that may be confiscated
by our customs house officers.</p>

<p>I have been ten days in the north of
Ireland and I met my first drunken man
in a third-class carriage.</p>

<p>Will the W. C. T. U. kindly make a
note of this? Allow me to repeat for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the benefit of those who took up the
paper after I had begun&mdash;I have been
ten days in Ireland and have traveled
afoot, acar, and on train and tram
through half a dozen northern counties
and have been on the outlook for picturesque
sights, and I saw my first
drunken man yesterday afternoon&mdash;the
afternoon of the tenth day.</p>

<p>He was in a third-class smoking compartment,
and in my hurry to make my
train I stepped in without noticing the
absence of the sign.</p>

<p>He was a very old and rather nice-looking,
clean-shaven man, and his instincts were
for the most part of the kindliest, but he
would have irritated Charles Dickens exceedingly,
for he was an inveterate spitter,
of wonderful aim, and, like the beautiful
lady in the vaudeville shows whose husband
surrounds her with knives without
once touching her, I was surrounded but
unharmed. When the old man saw my
straw hat a gleam of interest came into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
his dull eye, and he came over and sat
down right opposite me.</p>

<p>"Are ye a Yankee?" said he. I assured
him that I was. "I thought so be
your hat, but you don't talk like a
Yankee." So I handed him out a few
"by Goshes," which he failed to recognize
and told me plainly that he doubted
my nationality. Except for my hat I
was no Yankee. Now my hat was made
in New York, but I knew that this was a
subtlety that would pass him, so I again
proclaimed my nationality, and he asked
me with great politeness if I objected to
his smoking (keeping up his fusillade all
the time) and I with polite insincerity
told him that I didn't. For his intentions
were of the kindliest. I believe he would
have stopped spitting if I had asked him
to, but I hated to deprive so old a man of
so quiet a pleasure.</p>

<p>The talk now turned to the condition
of Ireland, and he told me in his
maudlin, thickly articulated way that
Ireland was on the eve of a great industrial
revival. As I had repeatedly
heard this from the lips of perfectly
sober people I believed it. I told him
that he would live to see a more prosperous
Ireland.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i11" src="images/i087.jpg" width="400" height="594" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Geese in Galway</span></p>

<p>This he refused to believe and once
more asked me if I was as American
as my hat. I assured him that perhaps
I was even more so and that his grandchildren
would surely live to see Triumphant
Ireland. This he accepted gladly,
and coming to his place of departure,
bade me kindly farewell, and stumbled
over his own feet out of the compartment.
And I immediately changed to one where
smoking was not allowed.</p>

<p>It was on the same journey that I
stopped at a place called Omagh, and
while waiting for a connection we were
at the station some time. I was reading,
but suddenly became conscious that some
young people were having a very happy
time, for peal after peal of laughter rang<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a><br /><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
through the station. After awhile I looked
up and found that I was the cause of all
this joy on the part of young Ireland.
There were three or four girls absolutely
absorbed in me and my appearance.
I supposed it was again the American
hat, but suddenly one of the girls
"pulled a face" that I recognized as a
caricature of my own none too merry
countenance, and the group went off into
new peals of merriment.</p>

<p>"How pleasant a thing it is," thought
I, "that by the mere exhibition of the
face nature gave me in America I can
amuse perfect strangers in a far-off land,"
and I smiled benignantly at the young
women, which had the effect of nearly
sending them into hysterics.</p>

<p>Life was a little darker for them after
the train pulled out, but I could not stay
in Omagh for the mere purpose of exciting
their risibles by the exposition of my
gloomy features.</p>

<p>Everywhere I go I am a marked man.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
I feared for a time that there was something
the matter with my appearance, but
at Enniskillen I fell in with a young locomotive
engineer from California, and he
told me that he too aroused attention
wherever he went, and that in Cork
youngsters followed him shouting "Yankee!"
Fancy a "Yankee" from California!</p>

<p>At Enniskillen I went for a walk with
this young engine driver and we passed
two pretty young girls, of whom he inquired
the way to the park. It seems
that the young women were on their way
there themselves and they very obligingly
showed us how to go. It occurred to
the gallant young Californian that such
an exhibition of kindliness was worth rewarding,
and he asked the ladies if they
did not care to stroll through the park.
They, having nothing else to do and the
evening being fine, consented, and we
made a merry quartette.</p>

<p>I have been somewhat disappointed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the Irishman as a wit in my actual contact
with him on his native heath, but
these girls showed that wit was still to
be found. They were very quick at
decorous repartee, and although my San
Francisco friend neglected to introduce
me to them (possibly because he did not
know their names), I paid a tribute to
their gifts of conversation.</p>

<p>Nor should it be imagined for a moment
that they were of that sisterhood so deservedly
despised by that estimable
and never to be too well thought of Mrs.
Grundy&mdash;they were simply working girls
who were out for an evening stroll and
who saw in a chance conversation with
representatives of the extreme east and
west of America an opportunity for
mental improvement.</p>

<p>They were, it may be, unconventional,
but how much more interesting are such
people than those whose lives are ordered
by rule.</p>

<p>We left the young women in the park<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
intent upon the glories of a day that was
dying hard (after eighteen hours of daylight)
and as we made our way to the
hotel we agreed that a similar readiness
to converse with strangers on the part
of young women in New York would
have given reasonable cause for various
speculations.</p>

<p>But Ireland has a well-earned reputation
for a certain thing, which the just
published table of vital statistics for the
year 1906 goes far to strengthen.</p>

<p>In the morning the young locomotive
pusher and myself had attended a cattle
show at Enniskillen fair grounds.</p>

<p>I don't mind saying that I had stayed
over a day in order to go to the fair, for
I have not read Irish literature for nothing,
and I was perfectly willing to see a fight
and ascertain the strength of a shillelagh
as compared with a Celtic skull.</p>

<p>It was a great day for Enniskillen and
for the Enniskillen Guards, who were
out in force. There were also pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
maidens from all the surrounding counties
and not a few of the gentry who had
been attracted by the jumping contests.</p>

<p>But&mdash;what a disappointment.</p>

<p>Irishmen? Why, you'll see more Irishmen
any pleasant day below Fourteenth
Street in New York. And those that
were there were so painfully well behaved
and quiet. And as for speaking the Irish
dialect&mdash;well, I wish that some of the
Irish comedians who have been persuaded
that Irishmen wear green whiskers would
come over here and listen to Irishmen
speak. They wouldn't understand them,
they speak so like other people.</p>

<p>For ginger and noise and varied interests
any New England cattle show
has this one beaten to a pulp&mdash;if one
may use so common an expression in a
newspaper.</p>

<p>The noisiest things there were the
bulls, and they were vociferous and huge.
But the men were soft spoken and there
seemed little of the "Well, I swan! I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
hain't seen you for more'n two years.
How's it goin'?" "Oh, fair to middlin'.
Able to set up an' eat spoon vittles"
atmosphere in the place, although undoubtedly
it was a great gathering of
people who seldom met. Not a single
side show. Not a three-card monte man
or a whip seller or a vendor of non-intoxicants.</p>

<p>There was just one man selling what
must have been mock oranges, for such
mockeries of oranges I never saw.
They were the size of peaches and the
engineer told me they were filled with
dusty pulp.</p>

<p>I bought none.</p>

<p>The racing and fence jumping in the
afternoon were interesting, but there was
no wild Yankee excitement on the part
of the crowd and no hilarity. There was
only one man that I noticed as having
taken more than was necessary, and the
only effect it had on him was to unlock
the flood gates of an incoherent eloquence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
that caused a great deal of amusement
to those who were able to extricate
a sequence of ideas from the alcoholic
freshet of words.</p>

<p>One venerable-looking man, with a
flowing white beard of the sort formerly
worn by Americans of the requisite years,
fell from a fence where he was viewing
the jumping and was knocked out for a
time. He had been "overcome by the
heat," at which, out of respect to him, I
took off my overcoat. The Irish idea of
heat is different from the New York one.</p>

<p>The splendid old fellow had served
thirty-three years on the police force and
had been a police pensioner for thirty-one
years, and as he must have been twenty-one
when he joined the force he was
upwards of eighty-five.</p>

<p>Would Edward Everett Hale view a
race from a picket fence? There is
something in the Irish air conducive
to longevity. In the evening I saw the
old man standing in the doorway of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
temperance hotel talking with men some
seventy years younger than he.</p>

<p>A local tradesman told me that in the
town of Enniskillen where formerly any
public gathering was sure to be followed
by a public fight, he had seen the Catholic
band and the Orangemen's band playing
amicably the same tune (I'll bet it wasn't
"The Wearing of the Green"), as they
marched side by side up the main street.</p>

<p>The world do move.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p class="h3"><i>A Few Irish Stories</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>IF</b> you enter Ireland by the north, as
I did, you will not hear really satisfying
Irish dialect until you reach Dublin.
The dialect in the north is very like Scotch,
yet if it were set down absolutely phonetically
it would be neither Scotch nor
Irish to the average reader, but a new and
hard dialect, and he would promptly skip
the story that was clothed in this strange
dress.</p>

<p>But in Dublin one hears two kinds
of speech, the most rolling, full and
satisfying dialect and also the most perfect
English to be found in the British
Isles.</p>

<p>It is a delight to hear one's mother
tongue spoken with such careless precision, with just the suspicion of a brogue
to it. I am told it is really the way that
English was spoken when the most successful
playwright was not Shaw, but
Shakespeare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The folk tale that follows was told
me, not by a Dublin jarvey, but by a
Dublin artist whose command of the
right word was as great as his command
of his brush.</p>

<p>He regaled me with many stories of
Irishmen and Ireland and never let pass
a chance to abuse the English in the most
amusingly good-natured way. To him
the English as a race were a hateful,
selfish lot. Most of the Englishmen he
knew personally were exceptions to this
rule, but he was convinced that the average
Englishman was a man who was nurtured
in selfishness and hypocritical
puritanism.</p>

<p>But this is far afield from his story of
the first looking glass.</p>

<p>Once upon a time (said my friend)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
a man was out walking by the edge of
the ocean and he picked up a looking
glass.</p>

<p>Into the glass he looked and he saw
there the face of himself.</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, "'tis a picture of my
father," and he took it to his cabin and
hung it on the wall. And often he would
go to look at it, and always he said, "'Tis
a picture of my father."</p>

<p>But one day he took to himself a wife,
and when she went to the mirror and
looked in she said:</p>

<p>"I thought you said this was a picture
of your father. Sure, it is a picture of an
ugly, red-headed woman. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"What have ye?" said the man.
"Step away and let me to it."</p>

<p>So she stepped away and let him to
it and he looked at it again.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he with a sigh (for his
father was dead), "'tis a picture of my
father."</p>

<p>"Step away," said she, "and let me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
see if it's no eyes at all I have. What
have you with pictures of women?"</p>

<p>So he stepped away and let her to it,
and she looked in it again.</p>

<p>"An ugly, red-headed woman it is,"
said she. "You had a lover before me,"
and she was very angry.</p>

<p>"Sure we'll leave it to the priest,"
said he.</p>

<p>And when the priest passed by they
called him in and said, "Father, tell us
what it is that this picture is about.
I say it is my father, who is dead."</p>

<p>"And I say it is a red-haired woman
I never saw," said the woman.</p>

<p>"Step away," said the priest, with
authority, "and let me to it."</p>

<p>So they stepped away and let the
priest to it, and he looked at it.</p>

<p>"Sure neither you nor the woman
was right. What eyes have ye? It is
a picture of a holy father. I will take it
to adorn the church."</p>

<p>And he took it away with him, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the gladness of the wife, who hated the
woman her husband had in the frame,
and to the grief of the man, who could
see his father no more.</p>

<p>But in the church was the picture of a
holy man.</p>

<p>Quite the folklore quality.</p>

<p>I heard a story of a well-known Dublin
priest, Father Healy, very witty and very
kindly, who was invited by a millionaire,
probably a brewer, to go on a cruise with
him.</p>

<p>Over the seas they sailed and landed
at many ports, and the priest could not
put his hand into his pocket, for he was
the guest of the millionaire.</p>

<p>At last they returned to Dublin and
the millionaire, being a man of simplicity
of character, the two took a tram to their
destination.</p>

<p>"Now it's my turn," said the priest,
with a twinkle in his eye, and, putting
his hand in his pocket, he paid the fare
for the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>And here's another.</p>

<p>Two Irishmen were in Berlin at a
music hall, and just in front of them sat
two officers with their shakos on their
heads.</p>

<p>Leaning forward, with a reputation
for courtesy to sustain, one of the Irishmen
said, pleasantly, "Please remove
your helmet; I can't see the stage for
the plume."</p>

<p>By way of reply the German officer
insolently flipped the Irishman in the
face with his glove.</p>

<p>In a second the Irishman was on his
feet and in another second the officer's
face was bleeding from a crashing blow.</p>

<p>Satisfaction having been thus obtained,
the two Irishmen left the cafe and returned
to their hotel, where they boasted
of the affair.</p>

<p>Fortunately kind friends at once
showed them the necessity of immediately
crossing the frontier.</p>

<p>That the Irishman had not been run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
through by the officer's sword was due
to the fact that he was a foreigner.</p>

<p>Speaking of fights, the other day an
American friend of mine was taking a
walk in Dublin and he came on a street
fight. Four men were engaged in it,
and no one else was interfering. Passers
by glanced over their shoulders and walked
on. Two women, evidently related to
the contestants, stood by awaiting the
result.</p>

<p>My friend mounted a flight of steps
and watched the affair with unaffected
interest.</p>

<p>A member of the Dublin constabulary
happened to pass the street, and, glancing
down, saw to his disgust that it was up
to him to stop a fight.</p>

<p>Slowly he paced toward them, giving
them time to finish at least one round.</p>

<p>But the two women saw him coming
and, rushing into the mixture of fists and
arms and legs, hustled the combatants
into the house, and the policeman went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
along his beat twirling, not his club,
but his waxed mustache.</p>

<p>I told a Dublin man of this incident,
deploring my luck in not having come
across it with my camera in my hand.</p>

<p>He said: "That policeman was undoubtedly
sorry that he happened on
the row. He would much have preferred
to let them fight it out while he
sauntered by on another street all unknowing.
Not that he was afraid to run
them in, but that an Irishman loves a
fight."</p>

<p>Another sight that I saw myself at a
time when my camera was not with me
was two little boys, not five years apiece,
engaged in a wrestling match under the
auspices of their father, who proudly
told me that they were very good at it.
The little fellows shook hands, flew at
each other, and wrestled for all they were
worth. And from the time they clinched
until one or the other was thrown they
were laughing with joy. They wrestled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
for several rounds, but the laughter never
left them.</p>

<p>How much better it is for little children
to learn to fight under the watchful
and appreciative eye of a kind father
than to learn at the hands of vindictive
strangers.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>Snapping and Tipping</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>THE</b> poor man never knows the
cares and responsibilities that beset
the man of wealth, and the man without
a kodak does not know how keen is the
disappointment of a picture missed&mdash;be
the cause what it may.</p>

<p>Heretofore I have traveled care free
for two reasons: one was I never had
any money to speak of, and the other
was I never carried a camera. I looked
at the superb view, or the picturesque
street group, solely for its passing interest,
with never a thought of locking it up in a
black box for the future delectation of
my friends, and to bore transient visitors
who, as I have noticed, always begin to
look up their time tables when the snapshot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
album is produced of a rainy Sunday
afternoon.</p>

<p>But this year some one with the glib
tongue of a salesman persuaded me of
the delights that were consequent on the
pressing of a button, and I purchased a
camera of the sort that makes its owner
a marked man.</p>

<p>The first two or three days I was as
conscious as a man who has just shaved
his mustache on a dare, and who expects
his wife home from the country any
minute. I fancied that every one knew
I was a novice, although even I hadn't
seen any of my pictures as yet.</p>

<p>I snapped a number of friends on the
steamer, and even had the audacity to
make the captain look pleasant&mdash;but
in his case it came natural, and really,
when it was printed, even strangers could
hear his hearty laugh whenever they
looked at the picture, so true to life was it.</p>

<p>Of course it was beginner's luck, but
as I went on snapping and getting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
films developed I found that I had picked
up a fine lens, and the pictures I was
taking were really worth while, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>Say, have you ever had hen fever?
Has your pulse ever quickened at sight
of an egg you could call your own?
Have you ever breathed hard, when the
old hen led forth thirteen fluffy chickens
and you reflected that thirteen chickens
would reach the egg-laying stage in seven
months, and that if each of them hatched
out thirteen you would have one hundred
and sixty-nine inside of a year&mdash;and
then have you gone out and bought
twenty old hens, so as to have wholesale
success&mdash;with deplorable results? If
you have done all these things you know
what a man does whose first snapshots
are successful. I laid in supplies of
films till my pockets bulged and my purse
looked lean.</p>

<p>And the first time the sun shone after
landing at 'Derry, I went out to see the
Giant's Causeway&mdash;and left my camera
behind me.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I experienced for the first time
the sensation as of personal loss, when
the views that might have been mine
were left where they grew.</p>

<p>On my way back I came on a hardened
old sinner of sixty odd years teaching
a little kiddie of four to smoke a
cigarette. If I had had my camera I
could have batted the old man over the
head with it. But it was in the hotel.</p>

<p>When I show my views to visitors
they will say, "And didn't you go to the
Giant's Causeway?" nor will they accept
my reason for the lack of a view.
And I feel that the set is incomplete.</p>

<p>As time went on I noticed several
things that are probably obvious to every
amateur. One was that on the days on
which I remembered to take my camera
I saw very commonplace subjects and
only snapped because I had the habit.
Another was that no matter how fine the
weather was when I set out with my
camera, it was sure to cloud up, just as we
reached the castle or met the pretty peasant
girl, who was only too willing to be
taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i15" src="images/i117.jpg" width="400" height="602" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">On the Road to Lismore, in a Rain Storm</span></p>

<p>One day I was walking from Cappoquin
to Lismore, all unconscious of what
lay before me, and just for wantonness I
took trees and pictures that might have
been in any country. At last I had but two
films left, and then the meeting of several
droves of cattle coming from Lismore
told me that it must be Fair Day there.
Just then lovely, noble, glorious Lismore
castle burst on my view and I had to
take it.</p>

<p>And then I came on the fair and saw
pictures at every turn.</p>

<p>Funny little donkeys with heads quite
buried in burlap bags the while they
sought for oats, gay-petticoated and
pretty-faced women in groups, grizzled
farmers that looked the part, waterbutts
on wheels in Rembrandtesque passageways,
leading to sunlit courtyards beyond&mdash;regular
prize winners if one had any
sort of luck.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a><br /><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>And then a man with an ingratiating
brogue asked me to take him and his cart
and almost before I knew it I had taken
a sow that weighed all of five hundred
pounds, and my snapshooting was over
for the day.</p>

<p>You may be sure that next day I went
well prepared, but Fair Day is only once a
month, and fair days are not much more
plentiful, and it rained all day, and the
only thing I saw worth taking was a sort
of Don Quixote windmill that had been
run by a horse probably years before the
expression "the curse o' Crummel"
(Cromwell) came to be used, and I was
in a swiftly moving train and there was a
woman in the way&mdash;oh! there's no doubt
that camerading is fascinating, but it is
also vexatious.</p>

<p>Still, my advice to those about to travel
is&mdash;take a camera. If it's a very rainy
Sunday you may want them to leave on
an early train.</p>

<p>Tipping is a subject that is always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
worth discussing. A man does not like
to give less than the usual tip, and he
ought not to give more, because it makes
it hard for the next man, who may not be
able to afford much of an expenditure.</p>

<p>Tipping in Ireland is a very mild
thing compared to continental tipping.
I'll never forget my first experience in
Amsterdam. I have spent many agreeable
and useful years since then, and
the world has been better for my presence,
for eighty-four months at least,
since that day, but the comic opera
features of that first wholesale tipping
stand out as if I heard the whole thing
last night at some Broadway theater.</p>

<p>There were two of us, and we had
spent two delightful days in Amsterdam,
doing the picture galleries and confirming
Baedeker as hard as we could, and now
we must give up the two huge rooms on
the first floor that we occupied at the
Grand Hotel (to give it a name) and make
our way to other Dutch hostelries.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>I said to Massenger, "How about
tipping? Does it obtain in Holland?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Massenger, with a
gleam in his eye. "It obtains all right.
You leave it to them."</p>

<p>"How much shall I leave to them?"
said I, looking at the small coins I had
withdrawn from my pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, we have been royally treated,
and there are a good many waiters and
chambermaids and 'portiers,' and a proprietor
or two, and the equivalent for
boots, and the 'bus driver."</p>

<p>"But how are we to get them all?"</p>

<p>"Just pay your bill and you'll get them
all right," said Massenger. (I should explain
that whoever travels with me is
called Massenger. It saves trouble.)</p>

<p>I did not quite understand, but I signified
my intention of paying my bill, and
the proprietor or his steward was all bows
and smiles, and handed it to me, at
the same time ringing a bell.</p>

<p>Then the chorus began to assemble.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Lads and maidens in the persons of
waiters whom I had never seen, and
chambermaids of whom I had never
heard, began to swarm into the office.</p>

<p>After they had ranged themselves picturesquely
the boots began to arrive.
Some from neighboring hotels who had
heard the bell came running in, and
grouped themselves behind the maids.
Then a head waiter who looked like a
tenor came seriously in and I expected
that in a moment I would hear:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis the very first of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though we've not a thing to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will stand here, anyway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand awhile and sing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I looked at Massenger and asked him
what it all meant.</p>

<p>"It's in our honor," said he. "We've
got to shell out."</p>

<p>And sure enough it was. We had to
disgorge pro rata to all the assembled
ones, and Massenger said afterward that
he thought one or two of the guests came
in for certain of our gratuities.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>When we stepped into the 'bus, quite
innocent of coins of any sort, I listened,
expecting to hear:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now, in spite of rainy day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have gone and made our hay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I don't care what you say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Yankees come this way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We get what they bring."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They got it all right, but I was quite
unnerved for some time. The attack
had been so sudden.</p>

<p>In Ireland there is nothing to equal
this for system, and a copper does make
a man feel grateful&mdash;or at least it does
make him express gratitude. I have yet
to hear curses in Ireland.</p>

<p>But when you visit private houses
you don't know what to do. Tips are
expected there&mdash;not by everybody, but
by maid and coachman, anyhow, and
you wonder what is the right thing to
do.</p>

<p>To be sure you have caused trouble.
You have placed your boots outside your
door, just as you have latterly learned
to do at home, and it was a maid who
gave them that dull polish that wears
out in a half hour. Leave polish behind
when you leave America&mdash;that seems, by
the way, to be the motto of a good many
traveling Americans, but I referred to the
kind that you can see your face in when
imparted by an Italian.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Milk Wagon, Mallow</span></p>

<p>I had an experience when on my
way to visit Lady &mdash;&mdash;, in County Monaghan,
in the central part of Ireland.</p>

<p>Just how much to tip a coachman
of a "Lady" I did not know. A shilling
did not seem enough, and two shillings
seemed a good deal, and the fellow
did not have the arrogance of an English
coachman. He was simple and kindly,
and was willing to talk to me, although he
never ventured a word unless I spoke to
him.</p>

<p>When I had alighted at Ballybully
station a ragged man had seized my
valise, and on ascertaining my destination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a><br /><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
had carried it to a smart jaunting
car driven by a liveried driver. I offered
him a copper, and he looked at it and
said, "Sure, you're too rich a man to be
contint with that."</p>

<p>So to contint meself I gave him sixpence,
just what I had paid for having
my trunk carried one hundred and eighty
miles, and climbed to the car.</p>

<p>On the way to the estate of Lady
Clancarty (to give her a name also) I
figured on what I'd better give. To give
too much would be as bad as to give too
little. Still, if it cost a sixpence for my
suit case to go a hundred yards, a three-mile
drive should be worth a half pound
at least.</p>

<p>At last, just as we were driving in at
the lodge gates, I foresaw that I must
make haste&mdash;as it would never do to
hand out my tip in the presence of my
hostess&mdash;so I reached over the "well"
and handed two shillings to the driver.
He seemed surprised and pulled a bit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
hard on the left line. There was a
swerve, a loud snap, and the step of the
car was broken short off against the gate!</p>

<p>I was conscience-stricken, but said not
a word for a minute. Then the driver
said, "I've been driving for twinty-three
years and niver had an accident before."</p>

<p>He had jumped out and thrown the
step into the "well" between us.</p>

<p>I had visions of the sacking of the old
family driver, and all because I had not
known how much of a gratuity to give
him.</p>

<p>But when I offered to make up the
damage he said, "Indeed an' I'll be
able to fix it myself." And fix it he did,
so that no one was the wiser.</p>

<p>But the pain of those few moments
when I expected to be driven into the
presence of my hostess with the car a
wreck will not soon fade.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was a good half
mile to the house after we left the lodge,
and when we arrived I jumped from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the seat without using the step, and no
one ever knew the humiliation that had
come to the driver after twenty-three
years.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>Random Remarks on Things Corkonian</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>THEY</b> told me that Cork was a very
dirty city. They even said it was
filthy, and they said it in such a way
as to reflect on Irishmen in general and
Corkonians in particular.</p>

<p>Yes, they said that Cork was a dirty
city, and so I found it&mdash;almost as dirty
as New York. This may sound like a
strong statement, but I mean it.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Cork I saw a hill
and made for it at once, because after
railway there is nothing that so takes
the kinks out of a fellow's legs as a walk
up a stiff hill. And anyhow I was on a
walking tour.</p>

<p>I arrived at the top about sunset. On
reading this sentence over I find that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
sounds as if the hill was an all-day journey,
but it was only a matter of a few
squares, and when I started the sun had
long since made up its mind to set.</p>

<p>In Ireland the sun takes on Irish
ways, and is just a little dilatory. It
always means to set, and it always does
set in time to avoid being out in the dark,
but it's "an unconscionably long time a
dying."</p>

<p>At the summit of the hill I saw a church
steeple that appealed to my esthetic
sense, and I asked a little boy what
church it was.</p>

<p>"Shandon churrch, sirr," said he with
the rapid and undulating utterance of
the Corkonian.</p>

<p>"Where the bells are?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, smiling. "And over
beyont is the Lee."</p>

<p>"The pleasant waters of the river
Lee," I quoted at him, and he smiled
again. Probably every traveler who goes
to Cork quotes the lovely old bit of doggerel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
but the Corkonian smiles and
smiles.</p>

<p>The river Lee runs through the center
of Cork, and at evening it is a favorite
place for fishing, also for learning to
swim on dry land.</p>

<p>The fishermen seem to fish for the
love of casting, and the little boys swim
on the pavement&mdash;two pursuits as useless
as they are pleasant. Over the
bridge the fishermen leaned, and cast their
lines in anything but pleasant places&mdash;for
the river is malodorous&mdash;and the
little boys stood on benches and dived
to the pavement, where they spat and
then went through the motions of swimming.</p>

<p>There were dozens of the little boys,
and most of them seemed to be brothers.
Some of them were quite expert in diving
backward, and all of them were dirty, but
they seemed to be happy. I could not
help thinking how soon the Celtic mind
begins to use symbols, for it was easy to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
see that when the boys spat it signified a
watering place to them. I dare say they
were breaking a city ordinance in spitting,
and if they knew that they were that much
happier&mdash;stolen sweets are the sweetest.</p>

<p>During the time I watched the setting
sun&mdash;which was still at it and, by the
way, performed some lovely variations on
a simple color scheme in the sky&mdash;not
even an eel was caught, but the fishermen
cast under the bridge, let their bait float
down the (un) pleasant waters, and drew
in their lines again and again&mdash;mute examples
of a patience that one does not
associate with Ireland.</p>

<p>At last I left them and started out to
find Shandon church, which seemed but
a few squares away.</p>

<p>My pathway led through the slums,
and up a hill so steep that I hope horses
only use it as a means of descent. I
passed one fireside where the folks looked
cosy and happy and warm. It was a
summer evening, but chilly, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
place into which I looked was a shop for
the sale of coal. Shoemakers' children
are generally barefooted, but these people
were burning their own coal, and the
mother and the dirty children sprawled
around the store or home, in a shadow-casting
way, that would have delighted
Mynheer Rembrandt if he had passed by.</p>

<p>I was struck with the population of
Cork. It was most of it on the sidewalk,
and nearly all of it was under sixteen.
Pretty faces, too, among them,
and happy looking. I think that sympathy
would have been wasted on them.
They had so much more room than they
would have had in New York, and they
were not any dirtier&mdash;than New Yorkers
of the same class.</p>

<p>After I had reached the top of the hill
I turned and looked for Shandon church
and it was gone. I asked a boy what had
become of it, and he told me that in
following my winding way through the
convolutions known as streets I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
gotten as far from the church as I could
in the time. He told me pleasantly just
how to go to get to the church, and it involved
going to the foot of the hill and
beginning again.</p>

<p>I asked a number of times after that,
and always got courteous but rapid
answers. The Irish are great talkers,
but the Corkonian could handicap himself
with a morning's silence, and beat
his brothers from other counties before
evening.</p>

<p>At last I came on the church, passing,
just before I reached it, the Greencoat
Hospital National School, with its quaint
and curious (to quote three of Poe's
words) statues of a green-coated boy
and girl.</p>

<p>I asked a man when the bells began to
ring (for I had been told that they only
rang at night).</p>

<p>"'Every quar-rter of an hour, sirr,
they'll be ringing in a couple of minutes,
sirr."</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Green Coat Hospital, Cork</span></p>

<p>One likes to indulge in a bit of sentiment
sometimes, and I stood and waited
to hear the bells of Shandon that sound
so grand on the pleasant waters of the
river Lee. I had left the Lee to the
fishermen and the make-believe swimmers,
but the bells would sound sweetly
here under the tower that held them.</p>

<p>A minute passed, and then another,
and then I heard music&mdash;music that
called forth old memories of days long
since dead. How it pealed out its delight
on the (icy) air of night. And how
well I knew the tune:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Down where the Wurzburger flows."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No, it was not the chimes, but a nurse
in the hospital at a piano. Before she
had finished, Shandon bells began, but
they played what did not blend with what
she sang, and I went on my way thinking
on the potency of music.</p>

<p>I passed on down where the river Lee
flowed, and the fishermen were still fishing,
but the little boys had tired of swimming.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a><br /><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Two signs met me at nearly every
corner. One read, "James J. Murphy
&amp; Co.," and the other "Beamish &amp;
Crawford," or "Crawford &amp; Beamish,"
I forget which. Both marked the places
of publicans (and sinners, I doubt not),
and both were brewers' names. The
publican's own name never appeared,
but these names were omnipresent.</p>

<p>Again I thought of Shandon bells,
and the romantic song, "Down Where
the Wurzburger Flows," and leaving the
Lee still flowing I sought my hotel.</p>

<p>I would like to make a revolutionary
statement, that is more often thought
than uttered, but before I make it, I
would like to say that there are two classes
of travelers: those who think there is
nothing in Europe that compares with
similar things in America, and those who
think there is nothing in America that
can hold a candle to similar things in
Europe.</p>

<p>I hope I belong to neither class. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
I mistake not, I am a Pharisee, and thank
my stars that I am not as other men are.
Most of us are Pharisees, but few will
admit it.</p>

<p>I began being a Pharisee when I was a
small child, and that is the time that most
people begin.</p>

<p>I kept it up. In this, I am&mdash;like the
multitude.</p>

<p>Having thus stated my position, let
me go on to say, that I am perfectly willing
to admit that this or that bit of scenery
in France, or Switzerland, or England,
or Ireland, lays over anything of the sort
I ever saw in America, if I think it does,
and I am equally willing to say, that
America has almost unknown bits that
are far better than admired and poet-ridden
places in Europe.</p>

<p>Twin Lakes in Connecticut is one of
them, and Killarney is a poet-ridden place.</p>

<p>Why, even in Ireland there are places
just as lovely as Killarney, but they have
not been written up, and so no one goes
to visit them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt that one of the worst things about
Killarney was the American sightseer,
and I came away soon.</p>

<p>Cook's tourists have never heard of
Twin Lakes, thank fortune, and it will
be some time before they (the lakes) are
spoiled.</p>

<p>The Lakes of Killarney are so beautiful
that they are worthy of the pen of a
poet, but the pen of a poet does not make
any lake more beautiful, and I am quarreling
because so many people refuse to
believe the evidence of their own senses,
and take their natural beauties at the
say so of another.</p>

<p>There is a tower going up in New York
at present, a tower that with the exception
of the Eiffel Tower is the tallest on earth.</p>

<p>Many persons look at it, reflect that it
is a skyscraper, and then dismiss it as
therefore hideous. But it is really very
beautiful, and seen from certain vantage
points, it is architecturally one of the
glories of New York.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A bit of Killarney</span></p>

<p>If it ever gains a reputation for beauty,
you will find persons raving over it, who
to-day class it among the "hideous skyscrapers."</p>

<p>A hundred years ago there were some
skyscrapers in Switzerland, and they were
thought to be hideous. After awhile a
man with a poet's eyes and a courageous
tongue visited them, and he said "The
Alps are beautiful."</p>

<p>When their reputation for beauty was
established, travelers left the region round
about the Rockies to go and rave over the
beauties of Switzerland.</p>

<p>That's all.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a><br /><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A Visit to Mount Mellaray</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>MANY</b> persons whom I met in Ireland
told me that I ought to go to
Mount Mellaray "for my sins." Mount
Mellaray (to those who don't know) is a
Trappist monastery, set among hills that
would be at once the temptation and
despair of a colorist in landscape.</p>

<p>To it go the brain and heart weary
from all countries, and the good monks
(there's no doubt that they are good)
welcome them whether they have money
or not.</p>

<p>They tell of a man who went to
Mount Mellaray and accepted the hospitality
of the inmates and on his going
away he did no more than bid them
good by. Not a penny did he leave behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
him, although he had sat at table
with the other guests several days.</p>

<p>Next year he came again for his soul's
rest, and the monks received him as an
old friend. Those who were not under
vows of silence spoke to him, the others
nodded to him, and once more he rested
on the side of the purple hills and partook
of their hospitality.</p>

<p>When it came time for him to go away
he left behind him&mdash;a pleasant impression,
but not a cent did he give to the
cause of charity.</p>

<p>Another year passed by, and he came
again. Hundreds had come in the meantime, and none so poor but had left something
in return for the restfulness and
peace that are to be had there.</p>

<p>Quite as an old friend he was now received
and was made to feel welcome.
No one knew who he was&mdash;perhaps he
was nobody&mdash;but on his going away for
the third time he showed that he had been
but <i>acting</i> the part of an ingrate, for he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
gave the father who acts as keeper of the
gate a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>This story I told to the jarvey who took
me up the hilly road to the monastery, and
he listened with interest, and when I had
finished he said, "It's quite true."</p>

<p>As I did not expect to visit it again I
made up my mind to do my giving on
leaving the place, but my hundred pound
notes are all in the future, and therefore
no one can ever tell a similar tale of me.</p>

<p>I must confess that, being a Protestant,
I felt a little compunction about going to
the place, but I had been assured that my
sect would make no difference, that the
fathers were glad to receive all who came,
and that I would be as well treated as
though I were a saint.</p>

<p>On my way up my jarvey told me of the
amount of good that the monks do, not
only in a spiritual, but in a material way,
by providing work for the able-bodied
men of the vicinity.</p>

<p>We passed a neat stone cottage with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
ivy growing on it, and a vigorous fuchsia
tree blooming in the garden, and he told
me that it was a government cottage and
rented for the absurd sum of a shilling a
week.</p>

<p>"And how much can a man earn in the
fields?" said I.</p>

<p>"A matter of ten shillings a week,"
was his reply.</p>

<p>Query: If a man gets ten dollars a
week in New York and lives in a crowded
Harlem flat for which he pays at least five
dollars a week, is he as well off as this
Irishman, in his native land, with all the
fresh air in the world, fowls and fresh
eggs, and butter of his wife's making, and
one of the loveliest views imaginable
before him?</p>

<p>But you'll find the man in the neat little
government cottage anxious to fly to the
land of dollars&mdash;and when he's there
he'll hand out more dollars to his landlord
for inadequate accommodations than
he could earn at home in a month of
Sundays.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Human nature is human nature, and
the daisies in the field over the pond are
always more beautiful than the ones that
lie at your feet.</p>

<p>I was received at the monastery by a
monk, who on learning that I wished to
become a guest, took me over to the guest
house, and there a white-robed father
took my surname, and I began to feel that
I had renounced the world, and that perhaps
I was trying something that I would
regret, and wouldn't mamma come and
get me.</p>

<p>But the bearded man before me was
kindly, and when I told him (not wishing
to sail under false colors) that I was a
Protestant, he told me that it was a fast
day, and had I dined.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had eaten heartily at
noon. "If ye have not dined we can give
you something substantial," said he, but
I decided that it would be better to be
treated as the other guests were to be
treated, and so I told him, and he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
that at six o'clock there would be tea, and
that at eight I would retire to my room,
and at ten all lights must be out.</p>

<p>It was raining dismally, but he said
that I could go for a walk in the garden,
or stay in my room, or go to the "smoke
shed," to smoke a pipe or a cigar.</p>

<p>I chose the smoke shed as I understood
there were other human beings there, and
although I had only been in the monastery
five minutes, I felt the need of companionship.</p>

<p>After a brother had taken my traps to
my room, I went out to the smoke shed,
and found there some ten or twelve guests,
five or six of them priests, and all Catholics
but myself.</p>

<p>They were very quiet as I came up,
and I feared to speak above a whisper
myself, but a jolly-looking priest, seeing a
newspaper sticking out of my raincoat
pocket, said: "Is that to-day's paper?"
and on my saying it was, he asked me if
he might borrow it, and then he stood up
in front of them all and said:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"The news of the day.... 'Irish
Ireland. A Leaguer's Point of View.'
'The French Trunk Horror.' 'The
Bachelor Tax,' discussed by Mr. Dooley."</p>

<p>"Rade that, father," said a young chap
with a twinkling eye.</p>

<p>"Sure it's in dialect," said the priest
with a smile, and his own brogue.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Go ahead. 'Tis a
dreary day."</p>

<p>The paper was the Dublin Independent,
and in a moment more I was listening
to the familiar humor of the funniest man
in America, and that in a monastery, of
all places.</p>

<p>"'This here pa-aper says,' said Mr.
Hennessy, 'that they're goin' to put a
tax on bachelors. That's r-right. Why
shudden't there be a tax on bachelors?
There's one on dogs.'"</p>

<p>Loud was the laughter in the smoke
shed at this sally, and none laughed louder
than those professional bachelors, the
priests.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Street in Youghal</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I suppose,' said Mr. Dooley, 'that
next year ye expect to see me throttin'
around with a leather collar an' a brass
tag on me neck. If me tax isn't paid
th' bachelor wagon'll come around, an'
th' bachelor catcher'll lasso me an' take
me to the pound, an' I'll be kept there
three days, an' thin, if still unclaimed,
I'll be dhrowned, onless th' pound keeper
takes a fancy to me.'" (Loud laughter
by priests and laymen.)</p>

<p>The ice thus broken by my friend
Dunne, I was soon in conversation with
the group, and discovered two compatriots
from Indiana, one a native of Ireland returning
to visit it once more before he departed,
the other his son.</p>

<p>Vesper bells broke up the talk, and I
went with the rest to chapel.</p>

<p>After vespers came "tea," which I had
supposed would be literally nothing else,
but there was the most delicious graham
bread I have had since I came to Ireland,
and unlimited milk. There was no butter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
as it was a fast day. This I regretted
keenly.</p>

<p>Talk went on among us all until a
bearded monk in white came in and began
to read passages from Thomas &agrave; Kempis.
His enunciation was peculiarly pure, and
I doubt not that he was a gentleman born.
It was a pleasure to hear such English.
While he read we were all silent.</p>

<p>After supper we went out to the garden,
and in a sheltered place (although we did
not need a shelter, as the fickle rain had
stopped) those who wished played a
spirited game that consisted of tossing
stones into a little pocket of earth. One
of the priests was an adept, and he carried
all before him.</p>

<p>In such simple pleasures, or in walking,
the evening was spent until it came time
to go to chapel again.</p>

<p>One of my companions (and they were
there from all parts of Ireland, and you
might hear the Scotch accent of the north,
the pure Dublin and Wicklow Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
English, the slightly thickened Waterford
variety, and the hurried talk of the Corkonian,
as well as other styles I could not
place&mdash;probably west coast dialects,
mournful and slow) asked me what I
thought of Ireland, and I told him my
impressions had been tremendously favorable
so far. He said that a man who
had returned not long since told him that
Ireland was hopelessly behind the times,
and I told him, for his comfort, that to
take one instance in which Ireland was
up to date, the tram service in Dublin was
far ahead of that of New York, both in
the elegance of its rolling stock, its cheapness,
and the civility of its employes. He
was much amused at the idea of horse cars
in New York. (Electric cars play an important
part in all the large Irish cities,
and a ride on the top of one to Howth, a
lovely suburb of Dublin, is worth every
bit of the eight cents it costs).</p>

<p>They have yet to introduce the transfer
system, but in other particulars, like Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
O'Reilly, "they're doin' dam' well."
All this I told him.</p>

<p>At eight I sought my room, where
there was reading matter suitable to
the place, but the candle was not conducive
to extended reading unless I held
it close to the book, and then it dazzled
me, and at nine o'clock I was in my bed,
and until two in the morning the house
was quiet, save for a snore here and there.
But at two the bells began to ring, and
kept it up at intervals all through the
night. I was told this, but "tired nature's
sweet restorer, balmy sleep," came
to my aid, and I dreamed it was a feast
day and that all the monks were sitting at
the breakfast table, singing at each other
joyfully.</p>

<p>Next day was a feast day (to my relief).
I was up at six, but it was some time after
that that I heard steps in the hall. I had
looked out of the window from time to
time, hoping to see some one in the garden.
The table of the duties of the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
hung in my room, and I noticed that
breakfast was at nine. Luckily I had
some chocolate, or I might have felt I was
likely to faint by the wayside.</p>

<p>I did not go to early devotion, and when
I heard the footsteps in the hall I opened
my door and found that it was Father
David, the keeper of the gate, going
around to see if any were still in bed.
When he saw me, he said to the brother
who accompanied him, "Oh, it doesn't
make any difference with him." Then
to me, "Would you like to walk in the
garden?" I said that I would, and
walked round and round its lonely paths
for over an hour, now and then eating a
square of chocolate to keep off death.</p>

<p>But before eight the good father came
and asked me if I'd like to see the interior
of the monastery, and he showed
me the bakeshop with its most up to date
ovens, and oh, how hungry the smell of
baking made me, and the steam-saw, and
the creamery, and the library with its old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
newspaper telling to Irishmen that Cromwell
had departed to his rest the day
before. Not very sorrowful news, that,
I imagine, to the Irishman of that day.</p>

<p>And Father David showed me and the
other Americans an incubator, and explained
the process, with an innocent circumstantiality
that we respected. Why
tell him that the woods were full of incubators
in America? The things that
appealed most to him, however, was the
big circular saw that would saw up a log
of wood in a "minyit."</p>

<p>With his permission I took a photograph
of a beautiful Irish cross in the
graveyard, but when I suggested my taking
him, he averted his palms at me.
Such vanities were not for him.</p>

<p>At breakfast there were eggs and milk
and tea, and delicious butter in abundance,
and the reading of some holy book by
Father David, which did not stop all
conversation. Being a feast day, there
was one priest who felt his tongue could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
be loosened, and he kept up an undercurrent
of conversation, to Father David's
annoyance, but it was a human touch that
was not out of place.</p>

<p>The monks are themselves vegetarians,
but a school is run in connection with the
monastery, and the students are allowed
meats.</p>

<p>At nine my jarvey called for me and
took me to the boat for Youghal, and I
made my offering and shook hands with
Father David, and felt that I had been
benefited by my stay in the retreat. I
even felt that had I more time at my disposal,
I would stay on for several days,
talking with the guests, pitching stones
into the hole, and looking at the rolling
landscape and the awe-inspiring hills
behind the chapel spire.</p>

<p>One thing in America had interested
Father David&mdash;the Thaw trial&mdash;and
he wanted to know if Thaw would be
hanged.</p>

<p>One day the only American news in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
'Derry papers was to the effect that Evelyn
Thaw thought of going on the stage.</p>

<p>Not our art, or our literature, or our
suppression of the boss, but the Thaw
trial, is the thing that has made a deep
impress on Great Britain and Ireland,
and everywhere I am asked to give an
opinion.</p>

<p>The Thaw trial was a matter of moment
to the good old man, with his incubators
and his steam saw and his
absence of personal vanity.</p>

<p>As half way down the mountain I
turned and looked back at the spire
against the somber hills (for it had begun
to rain) I wished that my camera would
take them for me, but I knew that snapshots
of hills are like literary snapshots&mdash;inadequate.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>A Dinner I Didn't Have</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>THE</b> best laid schemes of mice and
men aft gang aglee, or words to that
effect, and in a small village in County
Wicklow I fared differently from what
had been my expectation.</p>

<p>I had a letter to a literary man of whom
I had heard nothing but pleasant words,
and I looked forward to spending several
hours with him.</p>

<p>I had dispatched my letter of introduction
to him over night, intending to perch
on his door sill during a flight from Dublin
further south: Waterford and Cork.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful (whenever the
clouds rolled away from before the sun)
and as I left my grips in the station and
fared forth I imagined how pleasantly we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
would talk together on matters and
things, how soon we would find we had
mutual friends, how possible it was that
one or the other of us would commit the
bromide of "It's a small world after all,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>It was a long time before the dinner
hour, but if he invited me to stay on and
dine I would certainly do it. Tasteful
napery, handsome women, light and joyous
talk, delicate viands and sparkling
wines&mdash;</p>

<p>"Plaze, sorr, would ye help a poor man
to's dinner. I've walked from Ovoca the
day an' devil a bit or a sup is in me."</p>

<p>A beggar!</p>

<p>The idea of a man who never saw me
before asking me and evidently expecting
me to help him to a dinner.</p>

<p>But of course when you meet a fellow
out in the country away from professional
beggars you naturally feel like helping
him, particularly if the Irish weather is
so fine that it hasn't rained for a quarter
of an hour&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, thank ye, sorr. May your bed
in heaven be aisy an' may ye oversleep
on the day of judgment."</p>

<p>A kind wish.</p>

<p>As I walked on I couldn't help thinking
how similar was his case to my own. In
all probability he had the price of a meal
in his pocket when he met me and I too
had the price of several meals in my pocket
and even as he had "braced" a total
stranger, so I was about to do the same
thing, only I expected intellectual talk,
a dinner, possibly a drive around the
country, and when all was said and done
I wouldn't be able for my <i>quid pro quo</i>
to call down such a blessing as he had
given me.</p>

<p>At last I came to the lodge of Heatherdale
and asked if Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; was in.</p>

<p>He was not. He had gone by an early
train to Dublin and would not be back
until seven.</p>

<p>Oh, such a noise of falling air castles.</p>

<p>My letter had been to him, not to his
wife.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>I could not, or at least I felt that I
could not present my card to her and explain
that I was very much disappointed,
and would Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash; kindly entertain
me with intellectual talk and food and
drink.</p>

<p>I turned sadly away and put on my
raincoat (for it had begun to rain dismally
as soon as the lodgekeeper had told me
Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; was out) and made my way
back to the station, intending to take the
next train.</p>

<p>The urbane station master, resplendent
in a gay new uniform, told me kindly but
firmly that there was no train until seven
o'clock, that that train did not go as far
as Waterford, only to Wexford, and that
my through ticket to Waterford was good
for this day only and would be waste cardboard
when the morning dawned, and I
took the first train from Wexford there.</p>

<p>That meant the price of an excellent
dinner thrown away&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>An excellent dinner. It was twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
o'clock; time to begin to think of a dinner
of some kind.</p>

<p>No (said the station master) there was
no hotel in the place. I might get something
at some farmhouse, but no dinner
anywhere.</p>

<p>And Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; in Dublin for the day.
What good had the tramp's blessing done
me?</p>

<p>I left the station and walked toward the
village. At last I came to a "public"
and there I found my tramp drinking
porter with gusto&mdash;but nothing else.
His hunger had evidently departed. Perhaps
the same thing that had put it to
flight would allay mine.</p>

<p>But the first incivility that I have received
since I came to Ireland was offered
me here. The proprietress of the public
laughed at me and said that they had
nothing but bread in the house&mdash;and
she evidently did not care to part with that.</p>

<p>"There's a good hotel at Rathdrum,
sorr," said the tramp to me. "It's not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
five miles away an' the road light as a
feather, barrin' the mud."</p>

<p>I had no notion of going five miles
on the light road on the light breakfast
I had eaten&mdash;and no certainty that
there would be a dinner at Rathdrum,
so I left the public, and the rain having
stopped and the sunshine having come
out with a most businesslike air, as
much as to say, "See here, you clouds
have been running things altogether too
much lately; it's now my turn at the
wheel," I set out as blithely as I could
(with the thought of my letter of introduction
crossing Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; on his way
to town and me a homeless wanderer) and
before long I came to a little whitewashed
cabin in front of which a handsome old
woman in a man's cap was bending over
some flowers.</p>

<p>"Good morning. Can you let me have
something to eat?"</p>

<p>"Sure 'tis little I have," said she, with
a smile that took five years off her age.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some fresh eggs, perhaps, or some
milk?"</p>

<p>"Aye, I can give ye those, but me
house is no place for the likes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll be just what I want," said I,
and she went into the house and bade me
follow.</p>

<p>Fresh eggs and unlimited milk are not
the same as brill and young lamb and
sauterne and cigars and witty conversation,
but when you are hungry from outdoor
exercise they are not so bad.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Kelly, like every other man,
woman, and child in the whole of Ireland,
had relatives in America.</p>

<p>She'd a son there long since and Ja-mes
just turned twenty-one had gone there
this summer to the "states of Indiana.
Did I know the states of Indiana?"</p>

<p>I told her I did, that I'd been to them
many a time. And where did "Ja-mes
go to&mdash;to what city?"</p>

<p>To Lafayette (with as French an accent
as you'd wish) and was I ever there?</p>

<p>I was. Her face lighted up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>If I went there again would I ask for
Ja-mes Kelly an' he'd be her son an' as
fine a boy as ever left Ireland (with a true
Dublin roll of the r).</p>

<p>Still thinking of the dinner I had not
had at Heatherdale house I asked her if
she knew Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Sure I do, an' the finest man in all
Ireland. Me boy Ja-mes worked there
at gardening and whin he was leaving for
America Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; gave a dinner for
him to all the villagers and gave him a
watch with his name on it and 'in remimbrance
of Heatherdale' in it. Oh, yes, a
fine man an' humble. Sure, if Jimmy'd
be sick for a day it's Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; would be
down here in me cottage askin' afther him
an' could he be doing annything for him.</p>

<p>"Humbleness. That what the blissed
Lord taught us. He could have been
borrn in a palace, but he was borrn in a
stable in Bethleh<i>a</i>m. Are you a Catholic?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, never mind. There's arl kinds
of good people&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; a Protestant?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I dunno," was Mrs. Kelly's
guarded reply. "He goes to the Protestant
church, but I don't know what he
is, on'y he's a good man&mdash;none better
in all Ireland.</p>

<p>"The good Lord," she continued, as
she filled up my cup with rich milk (she
had no tumblers at all, she said), "taught
us to be kind to one another and to be
humble, the same as He was kind and
humble, although He could have had a
palace if He'd chosen, and if we keep
His commandments we'll all go to heaven,
but if we don't (here the good Mrs. Kelly
lowered her voice) we'll be damned in
everlasting fire. The Lord tells us so."</p>

<p>I told her that I had heard such things,
that I had a grandmother who taught
me all about "Bethleh<i>a</i>m" and the
rest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, the good woman," said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Kelly, feelingly. "Well, it's true. Be
kind and be good and be humble and
ye'll be rewarrded."</p>

<p>After I had finished the lunch she
asked me if I could take a picture of her.</p>

<p>I told her that I could, but she must
come out of doors. Off came her man's
cap and she arranged her wisps of white
hair and washed her face and then said,
"Be sure to get me eyes good and clear.
I do take a fairly (very) good picture, and
me eyes always come out fine."</p>

<p>The good woman had eyes she might
well be proud of in spite of her desire to
be humble, and they danced and snapped
with joy as I leveled the camera at her and
took her photograph.</p>

<p>All the afternoon I climbed the beautiful
heather purpled hills in the vicinity
with her youngest son, a boy of nineteen,
eating wild fraochans, a kind of whortle-berry,
and had "afternoon tea" with her
at six and then went on to catch my train.</p>

<p>The son was a very intelligent boy and
I was struck with his easy and correct
use of English. He told me that it was
easier to understand me than an Englishman,
and I took it as a compliment, for I
certainly never heard better English
spoken than is talked in the Dublin district
by rich and poor alike. London
and New York should come to Dublin
and vicinity to learn the proper pronunciation
of English.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>What Ireland Wants</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>BEFORE</b> I went to Ireland I imagined
the Irish standing in a crowd with
their right hands pointing to heaven and
all of them demanding home rule. But
talk about shades of opinion and political
differences at home, why, it's nothing to
the mixture here.</p>

<p>I meet a man to-day and as I shake his
hand I tell him with heartfelt sympathy
that I hope he'll get home rule, that most
of us are with him in the United States,
and he wrings my hand and tells me that
American sympathy is the thing that has
kept Ireland up.</p>

<p>My bosom swells with pride and I feel
that I have hit on just the right phrase
to use.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day I meet another Irishman, a
Protestant from Belfast, and as I wring his
hand with emotional fervor, I tell him that
I hope he'll get home rule, and he pulls his
hand from my grasp to bring it down on
desk or counter or table with impetuosity,
as he says, "Ireland doesn't want home
rule. If the phrase had never been
coined Ireland would be happy to-day.
What Ireland wants is less sympathy
from outsiders. If my child bumps his
head and begins to cry, I say, 'Sure it's
nothing. Brave boys like to bump their
heads,' and he begins to laugh and forgets
about it. But if a stranger says,
'Poor Patsy. It must hurt awfully,'
then he sets up a howl about it and fancies
he's injured. What Ireland needs is to
forget her troubles and her political disabilities
and work. An Irish workingman
in Ireland is the laziest man alive.
When he goes to America or Canada or
Australia and is released from priestly
authority he's a hard worker and a success,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
but Paddy in the fields is always
looking for saints' days&mdash;and finding
them&mdash;and when he finds them he takes
a holiday."</p>

<p>I am silent because I really know so
little about it, but next day I meet another
Protestant and I say to him, "I
suppose it's Rome rule that is killing
Ireland?"</p>

<p>He's up in the air at once and tells me
that it is the priests who are interesting
the peasants in the revival of industries
long dormant.</p>

<p>"Aren't the priests fine-looking men?"
says he.</p>

<p>"Yes," breaks in another Irishman,
"and they ought to be the fathers of
families. All that good blood going to
waste and their lines ending with them
instead of enriching the blood of Ireland
in future generations. That's what celibacy
does."</p>

<p>Another Irishman chimes in, "Oh, the
priests are not such a fine lot. The constabulary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
are, I'll admit, but the most of
them are as useless as the priests. Most
of their time is spent training canaries,
for there's little else for them to do in the
country districts. But the priests; sure
a man says, 'Oh, Jimmy's no good at
all at all. Let's make a priest of him.'"</p>

<p>"It's folly you're talking," says the one
who spoke for the priests. "There's not
a finer body of men in Ireland than the
priests."</p>

<p>"Oh," says the other, with Irish wit,
"there's white sheep in every fold, I'll
admit, but if Ireland was free from political
and religious domination, she'd be
able to stand upright and she wouldn't
need home rule."</p>

<p>All of which is very perplexing to the
man who came to Ireland thinking that
with the exception of a few Orangemen all
Ireland was working morning, noon, and
night for home rule.</p>

<p>Next day I meet a man I know to be a
Protestant and I say to him in my easy-going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
way (being all things to all men
when I am traveling, in order to save
wear and tear), "The Catholic religion
is keeping Ireland back, is it not?"</p>

<p>He looks at me for a moment and then
a spiritual light illumines his eyes and he
says: "Protestantism is always death to
arts. Look at Shakespeare, the last
Catholic that England had, as you might
say, and look at his work with its artistry,
its absence of dogmatism, and then look
at Protestant and tiresome Wordsworth
and Protestant and didactic Tennyson.
Spenser was a great artist. Spenser was
a Catholic. Catholicism emancipates the
artistic side of a man's nature, puritanism
seals it up, dams it, condemns him to
preach sermons.</p>

<p>"The Irish are the most artistic people
on the face of the earth when Protestantism
has not been allowed to stamp their
idealism out of them."</p>

<p>"But I thought you were a Protestant.
Then I suppose that you think that the
priests&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think that the priests ought never
to be allowed to tamper with education.
Spiritually they release Irishmen from
puritan fetters (I speak as a Protestant
and the son of a Protestant) but politically
and educationally they are millstones
about Ireland's neck."</p>

<p>I leave him and going to Hibernia Hall
in Dublin, where the work of Irish industries
is being displayed, and where
stands temporarily St. Gaudens's splendid
statue of Parnell, and I see there Augustine
Birrell, whom I believe to be one of
Ireland's warmest and truest friends.</p>

<p>I am talking to a handsome six-foot
priest.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's Birrell," I say to him.</p>

<p>"Yes," says he with a twinkle in his
Irish eyes, "'twould be a fine chance to
drop a little dynamite under him."</p>

<p>I leave the hall hurriedly and listen
outside for the explosion, meanwhile
wondering why a priest who wants home
rule hates Birrell, who has tried to give
Ireland a modified version of it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>I meet a literary Catholic and ask him
whether home rule would mean Rome
rule and he tells me that it would not; that
the Catholics would not stand for priestly
interference with politics; that the priests
themselves would not desire to interfere.</p>

<p>Next day I ask a jarvey if he wants
home rule and he says, "Begorry, higher
wages would be better. I'd not be botherin'
with home rule if there was enough
to keep me sons busy."</p>

<p>"Well, Michael, would home rule
mean Rome rule?"</p>

<p>"Sure it would. Isn't the pope the
head of the church?"</p>

<p>Ireland seems to be a house divided
against itself.</p>

<p>I like the father of the family very
much. We'll say he comes from the
south of Ireland and is a Catholic. He's
a witty man, a hospitable man, a cheery
man, but won't speak to his oldest son,
because he's a Belfast Unionist and believes
in letting well enough alone.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Lost in His Lunch, Mallow, County Kerry</span></p>

<p>Now the eldest son is a delightful
fellow. A little more reserved than his
southern father, but just as hospitable,
just as cheery&mdash;almost as witty. The
mother is a Sinn Feiner, an idealist of the
idealists. She believes that Irishmen
ought to withdraw from Parliament. She
urges her son, who is in Parliament, to
resign, to boycott England, to get his
brother members of Parliament to come
home and form a National Council in
Dublin. She doesn't believe in war, but
she hates England with an animosity that
is positively amusing to one whose forbears
fought England and had done with
the fight long ago. She won't speak to
her daughter, who believes in working
for home rule in season and out of season
in London.</p>

<p>The mother is witty and cheery, and,
oh, so hospitable, but when I visit the
daughter I don't mention the old lady to
her, for in spite of the ingrained love for
parents that is almost as strong in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a><br /><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Irishman as it is in a Chinaman, she says
very sharp things about her unpractical
mother. But when we leave politics
alone, she is cheery and witty, and always
as hospitable as she can be.</p>

<p>Now, if by means of arousing a truly
national spirit (and the Gaelic League is
going about it in the right way) this
family of witty and cheery and hospitable
people can be induced to sink minor
differences and act together they'll get
what they want&mdash;whatever that is. And
then won't they be the happy family?</p>

<p>And I'm sure I do hope with all my
heart that they'll get it.</p>

<p>For they won't be happy till they get it.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p class="h3"><i>A Hunt for Irish Fairies</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>"I'LL</b> niver forget wan gintleman that
kem here from America. He'd been
borrn here, but had gone to Chicago whin
he was a lad, an' he had made a fortune.</p>

<p>"He had hundreds under him, an' he
told me he had niver touched a drop of
liquor. Oh, he was the kind man. He
hired me car every day he was here, an' he
said anny time I wanted to sind anny of
me sons over, to sind them to him an' he'd
take them on an' pay them good wages.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was the ginerous man, too
ginerous in fact. He'd scatter his money
like water whin he'd be in liquor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you said he never
touched a drop, Michael."</p>

<p>"Oh," with a toss of the head. "Sure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
that was in America. Bein' on a holiday
here he tasted it, an' likin' the taste he
kep' on.</p>

<p>"Sure he'd fling money out be the
handfuls if I'd let him. I told him if he
done that the news of it would spread an'
some of the wilder ones would demand it
of him, an' wance I refused to go anny
further till he'd promise to stop throwin'
money away&mdash;half soverigns, mind ye.</p>

<p>"Ah, but he was the kind man, drunk
or sober. The day before he left&mdash;an'
he was here two or three weeks huntin' for
his birthplace&mdash;he said:</p>

<p>"'Michael, I've drank too much, but it
tasted good. After to-day not a drop I
touch, an' me goin' back to America.'</p>

<p>"Sure, I hope he didn't, for he had a
fine business of manufactures of some sort,
an' he says:</p>

<p>"'Sind them along, Mike, when they
does be old enough an' I'll give them good
jobs. Only they must l'ave liquor alone.'</p>

<p>"Ah, a kind man he was an' a true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
American. Wance I met Larrd Kinmare,
an' I took off me hat to him. 'Who's
that?' says he. 'Larrd Kinmare,' says
I. 'Why do you take off your hat to him?'
says he; 'he's only a man like yourself.'
I'll never forget that. Only a man like
meself."</p>

<p>I asked this same jarvey if he would like
to see home rule.</p>

<p>"Sure, better wages would be better."</p>

<p>There are many like him in Ireland,
men of the practical kind, who would
rather see prosperity than home rule, and
who evidently do not believe the two are
synonymous terms.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little more of this jarvey's
talk will not be uninteresting.</p>

<p>"What do you think of King Edward,
Michael?"</p>

<p>He looked at me seriously. "He's not
had a thri'l yit, but he seems a nice man.
When he was Prince of Wales he was here
to visit with his mother, the Queen of England,
and he wint to a nunnery, an' him a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Protestant, an' he kep' his hat off his head
all the time he was in. An' him a Protestant,
mind you. He seems a nice man,
but he hasn't had a thri'l yit."</p>

<p>There's simplicity for you. One need
not have the acknowledged tact of the best
king in Europe to keep off his hat in a
nunnery, but Michael had treasured the
anecdote forty years as the measure of a
ruler's merit.</p>

<p>But I am treading on dangerous ground
and it would be better to venture on fairy
ground.</p>

<p>One needs to live long among the Irish
peasants to get at their folklore. They
are invariably agreeable to strangers, as
Michael has shown himself to have been
to me, and are more than willing to talk
about America and the sorrows of Ireland,
but if the subject of fairy folk is broached
they seem to be anxious to change the
subject.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to get a little
insight into their beliefs, but before I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
touch on the topic I would like to scatter a
few thoughts on the subject of Irish wit.</p>

<p>Here I have set down a conversation of
a typical Irishman, but you will notice
that there is nothing witty in what he says.
In books he is witty, and in Scotland the
Scotchman is witty, as I had occasion to
notice many times last year when I was
there, but in Ireland (I record personal
impression) the Irishman is not witty, as I
met him in the peasant class.</p>

<p>I have conversed with dozens and
scarcely a witty reply have I had. Humor
often, but wit seldom. I sometimes think
that it is because I have used the wrong
tactics. Perhaps if I had bantered them
they would have retaliated.</p>

<p>I fancy that their reputation for wit is
largely of English manufacture, and that
the Englishman calls it forth by his undoubted
feeling of superiority. The wit
is at his expense.</p>

<p>We were passing a little opening in the
woods the day I rode with Michael and I
said to him:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would be a fine place for fairies."</p>

<p>He quickly turned his head and looked
at me.</p>

<p>"So it would," said he, "but they're all
gone now. Whin I was a boy the old
folks did be talkin' of them, but there's
none of them now."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said I sympathetically,
"but a friend of mine in Connecticut, an
Irishman, told me he'd been led by them
into a bog with their false lights."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Michael, quick as a wink,
"so have I. They'd lade you to folly
the light, an' the first thing ye'd know ye'd
be up to your waist in a bog. But there's
none of them hereabouts now."</p>

<p>And that ended Michael's remarks
about fairies. And that was further than
most of them would go until I met an old
woman on the west coast. She, after I
had gained her confidence, talked quite
freely.</p>

<p>I asked her if she had ever seen any of
the red leprechauns (I am not sure of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
spelling) that are so mischievous to housewives
and are so fond of cream, and while
she had not seen any herself a friend of
hers had seen two of them.</p>

<p>"Wan had a red cap on an' the other
was dressed all in green and they was
wrestlin' in a field.</p>

<p>"An wance I looked out of the winder,"
she had grown absorbed in her own talk
now&mdash;"an' I saw over there on the
mountain side a fair green field that never
was there before"&mdash;the mountain was
bald and rocky and bleak&mdash;"an' in it
was a lot of young lads and gerruls, all
dressed gayly, the lads and the gerruls
walking like this"&mdash;illustrating by undulatory
motions&mdash;"and full of happiness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I've seen the little folk, but
I don't mind them at all. The sight of
them comes to me when I'd not be thinking
of it, and it's little I care."</p>

<p>She tossed her head in evident superiority,
perhaps feeling that I might think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
it folly for a woman as old as she to see
things so out of the ken of an ordinary
mortal. But I showed an interest that
was perfectly genuine, and she went further
into her revelations.</p>

<p>"Wance I was lookin' out of this same
winder, an' a queen of the air came out of
the heavens ridin' on a cloud. Oh, she
was the most beautifully made woman I
ever saw, with a stride on her like a queen.</p>

<p>"She had a short skirt on her, and her
calves were lovely, and around her waist
was a sash with a loose knot in it for a
dagger, an' the dagger raised in her right
hand&mdash;an' a crown upon her head."</p>

<p>"And did she look angry?"</p>

<p>"Indeed she didn't. A beautiful face
she had, an' she come straight for this
winder, an' when she was almost before it
I put up my hands to my eyes, for I
thought that if she was coming out of the
other space and I was the first she met
here she might do harm to me, and 'twas
well not to look at her&mdash;and when I
opened my eyes again she was gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, never will I see so finely made a
woman again; the calves of her beautiful
legs, and the arm raised high above her
head like a queen."</p>

<p>Margaret stood looking out of the
window at the mountain opposite, and I
said nothing for fear she would stop talking.
After a few moments she went on:</p>

<p>"Wan day I saw an elephant over on
the mountain side an' him filling his trunk,
with water for a long journey&mdash;Oh, it's
manny the thing I see, but I don't mind if
I never see them, only they come to me."</p>

<p>Filling one's trunk with water for a long
journey would not appeal to a drummer,
but this flippant thought I did not extend
to Margaret. Perhaps she would not
have understood, as drummers are bagmen
on the other side. That is they are
bagmen in books. In hotels they are
commercial men.</p>

<p>Margaret was not yet through telling
me the things she had seen. I was told
that there were some people that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
would not talk to on occult subjects, fearing
their badinage, but her sincerity was
so evident that I could not have joked
with her on the subject if I had thought
of doing so.</p>

<p>"Wance I saw the present King Edward,
an' him about to be crowned, an'
he was in the heavens lying on a bed, and
his wife standing near, dressed in a dress
with short sleeves an' point lace on them,
an' I said to me master,"&mdash;Margaret
was living in service,&mdash;"'Sure he'll not be
crowned this time.'</p>

<p>"An' that very evening the news came
that the King was ill, and he was not
crowned that time at all. An' the pitchers
in the papers afterward showed the
Queen in point lace as I had seen her."</p>

<p>Afterward I talked to the gentleman for
whom this ancient woman kept house,
and he said there was no end to the queer
things she had seen. He told me that
once she saw in "the heavens" a funeral
cort&eacute;ge issuing from a smallish house,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
with big black horses, plumed and draped,
and drawing a hearse, and in it either the
pope or the queen.</p>

<p>"Some one high up," Margaret said.</p>

<p>That evening came the news of the
death of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Of course this is "merely" second
sight, but if you don't believe in such
things you don't feel like scoffing when
people see visions that come true.</p>

<p>I was unfortunate enough not to meet
a Galway woman, an ignorant peasant,
who saw a vision that shaped itself around
a ruined castle.</p>

<p>She said to my informant (one of the
leaders in the Gaelic revival) that while
she was looking at the castle one day a
band of young gentlemen on horseback
and strangely dressed came riding up to
the castle, and in the windows of it were
many handsome women, gayly dressed
and with their hair brushed up from their
foreheads, and they were laughing and
talking.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>And when the young horsemen came
to the ditch that was around the castle a
platform that was laid against the wall
was let down by chains, and over the
bridge thus made the gay young men
rode and joined the chattering ladies.</p>

<p>This was a woman who would not have
heard of moats and drawbridges, and but
little of the castle remained save the four
walls. She had seen a vision, so my informant,
a woman of forceful intellect,
told me&mdash;and I believed it then, and half
believe it now. If one has visions why not
see them? I wish I might myself.</p>

<p>But it is very hard for the traveler to
get at these revelations. The natives are
shy of strangers, who like as not do not
believe in fairies&mdash;never having seen
Tinker Bell&mdash;and they will not talk.</p>

<p>But for my part I hope the time will
come when it will be proved beyond a
doubt that there are fairies, and if the
revelation ever does manifest itself at all,
doubting Thomases and the rest, I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
sure that their habitat will prove to be
Ireland.</p>

<p>And when they are proved to exist, remember
that I said I believed in them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p class="h3"><i>In Galway with a Camera</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>GALWAY</b> comes as near as any Irish
city that I ever saw to rivaling
New York's East Side for dirtiness, and
yet a fair-minded observer would be compelled
to tell Galway, when the time for
awarding the leather medal came, that
she was only a close second.</p>

<p>This does not so much mean that New
York is dirtier than I realized she was
when I was there as it means that Ireland
is not as dirty as English and Irish and
American writers have pictured it.</p>

<p>Perhaps in some parts of Ireland the
pig still sleeps in the room with the family,
but as a faithful chronicler of actual sights
I cannot say that I saw such a sight in any
of the numerous slums and villages I
visited in twenty counties. I hate to
destroy so poetic an illusion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Picturesque Galway</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>There was something idyllic in the
thought of a pink little pig and a pink little
boy, the two of them the pink of neatness,
lying side by side in a happy-hearted Irishman's
cabin, while pig and boy and Irishman
starved to death, but the truth was
something better than that. There were
pigs and little boys, but they were not
neatly pink and they were not starving,
and the old man did not swing a shillelagh
or sing songs as I was passing by.</p>

<p>Shillelaghs were never so plentiful as
they are now, but they are made to supply
the foreign demand for them, and the
Irishman is amused and perhaps a bit
contemptuous as he sees Americans, with
never a drop of Irish blood in them, buying
shillelaghs to take home for the sake of
sentiment.</p>

<p>I wish I might write that I saw evidences
of destitution on every side&mdash;it
would please the sentimentalists&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
I did not. There were beggars, but not
so many as I had feared I would see, and
they did not chase me any harder than
youngsters have chased me in City Hall
Park in New York demanding a cent to
buy sterilized milk.</p>

<p>In Sligo I was followed by a poor
woman carrying a baby, and as she raised
her hand for alms her shawl dropped off
and disclosed her nakedness to the waist,
but I was assured by a Sligo gentleman
that she was a professional beggar from
out of town, and that possibly the baby
was not hers, and I know for a fact that
she went to a public house with the money
I gave her.</p>

<p>And all the time I was fumbling in my
pocket for coppers she was wishing me
happy days. She stands out in my recollection
as the most abject beggar I saw.</p>

<p>But in Galway there is dirt and squalor
and it is picturesque. There in the Claddagh
one meets with old hags who are hideous
enough and Spanish looking enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to have just left Velasquez's studio, where
one can imagine them posing as models for
some masterpiece of the great realist.</p>

<p>Barefooted they are, and the homely
ones have a great desire to be photographed.
Many and many were the
pretty women I saw in Ireland, but my
camera recorded but few of their lineaments,
while I was asked more than once
by plain women to take their pictures.</p>

<p>One nailed me as I was passing her
vegetable shop in the Claddagh. She was
cross-eyed, poor thing, and in a land where
pretty features are as plentiful as blackberries,
she was plain, but she besought
me to take her picture.</p>

<p>Now, when a woman asks you to photograph
her you don't feel like refusing her,
and I was too much of a novice to make a
feint at snapping the shutter and passing
on, so I stopped and tried to see a picture
in the carrots and cabbages that were displayed
at the door.</p>

<p>Such a simpering, conscious face as she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
displayed! I tried to engage her in talk
so that she would at least look naturally
homely, but it was no use. Every time
my finger strayed up to the little lever her
lips would become set in a smile, one eye
would look at the camera and one would
look at me, and she would become the incarnation
of consciousness.</p>

<p>At last I snapped her and passed on.
After that I took good care to hurry past
plain women.</p>

<p>The day before, at a railway station,
I had gone in to get a bit of lunch and discovered
that one of the waitresses was a
little beauty. The thought came into my
head, What a model for "An Irish
Beauty," just as one of the others, who
had no claim to beauty, said, "Take me
picture?"</p>

<p>I told her that I was not a professional,
looking all the while at the pretty one,
but she suggested that I take all three
waitresses just for fun, and in order to get
the beauty at any cost I assented, and the
girls stood in expectant attitudes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A String of Fishermen, Galway</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>The beauty was so luscious looking that
the other two were simply obliterated in
the finder, and I felt myself lucky at having
such a chance to carry away a permanent
impression of Irish maidenhood.</p>

<p>My hand was raised to the lever, in another
instant the face would be mine, but
just then the door opened and a man
came in to buy a measly sandwich.</p>

<p>One of the girls left the group&mdash;I could
see that in the finder, but I snapped hastily
and then looked up.</p>

<p>It was the beauty.</p>

<p>I have the other two. They are undeveloped.</p>

<p>In the Claddagh a pretty little child
came up to me and asked me to take her
"piccher," hoping for some coppers in
payment.</p>

<p>I nodded my head to her, but a barefooted
derelict ahead of me heard her request,
and wheeling around suddenly bade
the child be off and offered to pose for me
herself.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Velasquez would have jumped at the
chance, but I am not Velasquez and I
shook my head and hurried on.</p>

<p>The vehemence of the old woman's vituperative
assault on the little girl had
collected a lot of loungers of both sexes,
and I was besieged for pictures, the pretty
little girl saying incessantly, "I as't you
firrst. I as't you firrst. I as't you firrst."</p>

<p>I managed to make her understand that
if she walked on far enough I would take
her picture, and only one other heard her,
another little girl who was pretty enough
to grace a film.</p>

<p>These two kept on, while the others
dropped away when they saw I was adamant.</p>

<p>And when my models were far enough
from the others to enable me to get them
before it was suspected what I was at I
snapped them and put my hand into my
pocket to get up a couple of coppers and
found nothing but a sixpence.</p>

<p>Of course the children could not change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
it, and I could not very well divide it, so I
appealed to some fishermen who were
lounging on the quay, asking them if they
could give me coppers for a sixpence.</p>

<p>They gave me to understand that both
coppers and sixpences were strangers to
them, and evidently felt that, as a "rich
American" I could easily give each child
a shilling. But this would have been to
get the whole pack on me, for they already
smelt money and were coming up.</p>

<p>So I gave the sixpence to the one who
had first spoken to me and told her to keep
fourpence for herself and to give tuppence
to her little friend.</p>

<p>I'm afraid they came to blows over it.
As for me, I left the picturesque Claddagh
and saw it no more.</p>

<p>It was that same morning that I had
seen the entire population lining one of
the narrowest streets in that part of Galway,
and there I got shot after shot of the
picturesque groups.</p>

<p>I asked what they were waiting for, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
one of the mackerel selling and barefooted
Velasquez women told me that an American
circus was coming.</p>

<p>I felt it was worth waiting to see an
American circus in Galway.</p>

<p>The circus was called "Buff Bill's Wild
West Show." Not Buffalo Bill, mind you,
but Buff Bill.</p>

<p>For a long time I waited and at last my
patience was rewarded.</p>

<p>I knew just what it would be. There
would be fifty or sixty cowboys on their
broncos, a bevy of female sharpshooters,
and the Deadwood stage; and for the circus
part of it an elephant or two and the
$10,000 beauty, followed up by dens of
wild beasts and representatives of all the
countries of the world.</p>

<p>At last music was heard. The band
was approaching. Around a bend in the
street came the usual crowd of small boys
and girls running ahead.</p>

<p>Then came a yellow wagon, with a cowboy
band discoursing the latest New York
favorite.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Waiting for the Circus, Galway</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Next came one dreadful dwarf, made
up as a hideous clown. Behind him rode
an ordinary negro, not costumed in any
special manner. He was enough novelty
as he was.</p>

<p>And behind these two rode a man of the
toothpowder vender type, with long hair,
<i>boiled shirt</i>, sombrero, and no necktie.</p>

<p>He was Buff Bill.</p>

<p>And that made up the parade.</p>

<p>It was worth waiting for, if only to see
what it is that constitutes a wondrous
spectacle to a small boy.</p>

<p>Fifty years from now some prosperous
Chicagoan will take his grandson to see a
four-mile parade of some great circus of
the period, with half a hundred elephants,
a thousand noble horsemen, and scores of
gilded chariots; and when the small boy
voices his rapture the old man will say
with sincerity:</p>

<p>"It's pretty good, I suppose, but you
ought to have seen the circus that came to
Galway when I was a boy of eight. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
beat any circus I've ever seen since. I
couldn't sleep for weeks thinking about
it."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="h3"><i>The New Life in Ireland</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><b>NO</b> one can be in Ireland long without
realizing that when sturdy, practical
John Bull forcibly married dreamy Hibernia,
with her artistic temperament, it
was a very foolish marriage, and as a good
American I could have predicted trouble
from the very start. John Bull is accustomed
to be obeyed at the drop of the
hat, and Hibernia, for all her dreaminess,
is a lady of spirit and will not become
a willing slave.</p>

<p>John Bull has no more knowledge of the
real needs and capabilities of this Irish
wife of his than the average American has
of the real needs and capabilities of an
Indian, and the result of the union has
been a series of bickerings that show John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
up in his worst light and that do not serve
to call out the most agreeable aspects of
his unfortunate wife's nature.</p>

<p>He suspects her, and what good woman
will stand being suspected by her husband
without resentment? In her temperamental
qualities&mdash;qualities that could be
cultivated to express something noble&mdash;he
sees only idleness and shiftlessness. He
treats his wife as a child, and the wife who
is treated as a child becomes a mighty poor
mother.</p>

<p>That Hibernia is a failure as a mother
is shown by the fact that thousands of her
sons are still willing and even anxious to
leave her instead of staying and showing
by their industry and sobriety and willingness
to make the most of the opportunities
that undoubtedly exist in Ireland, that they
are capable of developing and governing
their native land without interference of
any kind from John Bull.</p>

<p>Ordinarily I'm quite opposed to divorce,
and I know that Catholics abhor it, but it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
seems as if Hibernia ought to get a decree
against John Bull on the plea of incompatibility
of temper. And I wouldn't
advise Hibernia to rush into marriage
again after she gets her freedom.</p>

<p>But through what courts she is to get
her decree is beyond my knowledge. She's
a most attractive lady and she has fertile
farms and some say undeveloped mines,
and there is certainly land enough, setting
aside the fact of ownership, to support all
the sons who have stayed by her.</p>

<p>Every Irishman in America who loves
Ireland, and I can't imagine that there
are any who do not, ought to advise
against further immigration. Ireland
needs every able-bodied man to help
carry on the work there is to do&mdash;a work
that the Gaelic League is doing so much
to foster.</p>

<p>The Gaelic League with its fostering
of the artistic spirit that is dormant in the
Irish nature, and that already finds expression
in the weaving of rugs and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
embroidery and in bookbinding and the
making of stained glass, and the Irish
Agricultural Organization Society, with
its introduction of modern scientific
methods of farming, its model hospitals
and schoolhouses and dwellings&mdash;these
movements are waking great interest
among the younger people. And Ireland
cannot afford to part with a single man or
woman from now on.</p>

<p>The study of Gaelic increases year by
year, and whereas in former times Irishmen,
subdued by the English spirit, punished
their children if they were caught
talking Gaelic, now Irishmen encourage
them and they are freely learning Gaelic
in all parts of Ireland. This movement
cannot help revivifying a national spirit.</p>

<p>In a railway carriage I talked with some
young women who, with their brothers,
were returning from a three days' fast and
an all night vigil at a little village near
Bundoran. They were of course Roman
Catholics. They asked me if I was going
to the national festival about to be held in
Dublin, the Oireachtas, and when I
found out what it meant I told them that
I was, and asked them if they were members
of the Gaelic League.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i27" src="images/i225.jpg" width="400" height="590" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gaelic Sign, Donegal</span></p>

<p>"Indeed we are," said one, and her eyes
glowed with enthusiasm as she said it.</p>

<p>"And do you speak Gaelic?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. We've learned it, you understand,
learned it since growing up."</p>

<p>They were heart and soul in the new
movement that it is hoped will regenerate
and cultivate and spiritualize Ireland, and
while I was talking to them and felt their
sincerity and ardor, I was sure that the
Gaelic League was doing more than all
the politicians ever could.</p>

<p>It is not the Catholics only that have
joined this movement; it is non-sectarian.
I talked with a young drug clerk in a
northern town and he "had the Irish"
(could talk Gaelic), and wrote his name in
Gaelic characters, but he was a Protestant.
He offered to give me a line to a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a><br /><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Dublin literary man, which shows
how democratic the movement is.</p>

<p>To-day you'll meet with a land-owning
aristocrat who is interested in what the
league is doing, and to-morrow you'll meet
a jarvey who is learning Gaelic, and the
next day a young lady of gentle birth who
is teaching the poor children of the neighborhood
how to weave rugs, and then
you'll meet an artist who was formerly
a land owner and a Protestant, and who
was one of the first to sell his property to
his tenants under the Wyndham act&mdash;and
being an artist and not a business man
he got ruinous prices for it&mdash;and has been
forced ever since to rely on his brush for
his support. He, too, is heart and soul in
the movement.</p>

<p>Now when the yeast permeates the
lump to such an extent there is bound to
be a rising&mdash;but of the peaceful kind.</p>

<p>"Pat," in his "Economics for Irishmen,"
says, "Were I a priest, I should,
I think, regard it as a sin on my soul every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
time a young person emigrated from my
parish while I might have shown him how
he could have made an excellent living
at home."</p>

<p>It must strike every American, no
matter whether he is a Protestant, an
atheist, an agnostic, or a Roman Catholic,
so long as he is open minded, that the size
and evident costliness of the churches in
the country districts is out of all proportion
to the costliness of the houses of the
peasants.</p>

<p>In a poor community money that is put
into costly bricks and stone that might
have been put into books and bread is
money inadequately expended, even if
Ruskin rise from his grave to contradict
me. A better temple to God than a
granite church is a granite constitution,
and the light of health and sanity and
cheerful industry in the eye of an Irish lad
is better than the light of a thousand
candles.</p>

<p>This is not a question of religion, but of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
common sense. If all the money that has
been spent upon the extra embellishment
of churches of all denominations in Ireland
had been spent on the physical and
educational and moral betterment of Irishmen,
they would have ceased to emigrate
long since.</p>

<p>But this is thin ice, and as I can't swim
I'll give up the skating on it until the
weather is colder.</p>

<p>But the priests are also interested in
this Gaelic revival of which Americans
have already heard so much, and which is
non-sectarian and non-political. And
the nuns are doing a blessed work all over
Ireland.</p>

<p>Let me close this somewhat serious
chapter&mdash;one can't help being serious in
Ireland when he sees that her regeneration
is at hand&mdash;with a parable that I
made all by my lonesome:</p>

<p>Once there was a man who had a sugar
maple, and there being a demand for
maple sugar he allowed the sap to run
early and late, and disposed of the sugar
thus obtained. But there came by a man
who said:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gone to America</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, you're ruining that tree. The
sap that is being made into sugar for the
whole United States is the life blood of that
green old tree. If you keep on, your tree
will wither and die."</p>

<p>And the man took the advice and the
tree renewed its youth.</p>

<p>Close up the sap holes and keep in the
sap, for the sap is the life blood of Ireland,
and we in America have learned how to
make sugar out of many things&mdash;even
out of beets&mdash;and we no longer need the
Irish young man. But the old tree needs
her young blood in order to keep her
fresh and green.</p>
